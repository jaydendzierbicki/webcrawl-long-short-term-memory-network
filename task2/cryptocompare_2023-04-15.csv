However, the exact impact on the price will depend on a number of factors, including market demand, investor sentiment, and regulatory developments.When will be the next stock market crash?It's impossible to predict the exact timing of a stock market crash. Market crashes are typically caused by a combination of factors, including economic conditions, geopolitical events, and investor sentiment.Why is it possible for XRP to reach 589 USD?The value of XRP, like any cryptocurrency, is subject to a multitude of factors, including market demand, regulatory developments, adoption, and investor sentiment. If these factors were to align in a way that increases demand for XRP and drives up its price, it could theoretically reach the value of 589 USD. However, there is no guarantee that this will happen, and the future price of XRP will depend on a number of variables that are difficult to predict.What are the conditions for XRP to overcome Bitcoin in market capitalization?For XRP to surpass Bitcoin in market capitalization, it would need to see a significant increase in usage and adoption, both among individuals and institutions. Additionally, XRP would need to have technology that is significantly more advanced or user-friendly than Bitcoin, which would make it a more attractive option for investors and users. Other factors that could impact the market capitalization of XRP include positive regulatory developments and a shift in market sentiment towards XRP.What could be the XRP value if it wins the SEC lawsuit and is now considered a currency instead of a security?If XRP were to win the SEC lawsuit and be considered a currency instead of a security, this could potentially increase market confidence in the token and lead to increased demand. Additionally, if XRP were to be considered a currency, it would likely see increased usage for everyday transactions, which could also drive up its price. However, the exact impact on the price of XRP will depend on a number of variables that are difficult to predict."""

2023-02-01 07:43:00,"Eleanor Terrett, a Fox Business journalist reported that the SEC lawyer involved in the LBRY lawsuit conceded on the record that the secondary market sales of LBC tokens do not constitute a security. While Attorney stated that the judge talked about an article while he forced the commission to commit on record.As expected, Judge ruled that the secondary market transactions of LBRY tokens by people unaffiliated with no investment intent in the LBRY case are legal. This could directly set a precedent for the XRP holders in the long running XRP lawsuit."

2023-01-28 07:31:00,there are 50 billion tokens in stock.. plus 50 billion in escrow and they will also be added in the coming years.  so in the end total 100 billion xrp tokens.. it is impossible for xrp to go above 5/10 dollars.  and then you have the lawsuit.  Honestly you are better off investing in a coin that is much more secure and can generate just as much profit.  my opinion

2023-01-19 04:32:00,"Just my opinion: Another mini pump and dump. Whales can't make money waiting for the Ripple/Sec case to settle. I would not take it as any sign. There are piles of money on the side line waiting for the case to come to an end. If Ripple/Xrp  wins the sky is the limit. If it loses many will be bailing out foolishly. Ripple/Xrp would move it's operations to a foreign Asian country or U.K.  The USA banking industry will think they too won as they will not use Ripple/XRP. This is not true. Do you think customers of all sorts, both public/ private customers would pay the exorbitant money transfer prices in addition to the time it takes for transfers in comparison to Ripple/Sec. They would easily switch to foreign banks that embrace Ripp/Xrp To reap the benefits.  Just think of all the money the USA operated banks would lose?I see Ripple/Xrp in a no lose situation. My play if they lose would be to sit tight until the dust settles and wait for round two of this fight."

To name a few of the big misses: Celsius, Voyager, Three Arrow Capital and the biggest of all FXT.Gary himself met with Sam Bankman Fraud  (pun intended) quite a few times and recently asked for one of the SEC directors to resign and take the fall for it. As the Republicans are now taking over, Gary will have to answer quite a few questions on how he is spending a lot of time, money and resources on non-fraud cases (Ripple, LBRY, Kim Karsdashian) and missed the big cases mentioned above.  As with every politician that only gets reprimanded by taking another office, I would not be surprised to hear Gary will move up in the world of politics after these massive failures.  After all,  his tenure at CFTC was as bad as the one he's performing at the SEC, hence why he's been awarded the current role in the first place.						View Edits"

Since then, the value has fluctuated around USD 20,000. For bitcoin proponents, the seeming stabilization signals a breather on the way to new heights.

The SEC will strive to keep these materials under wraps, which will not be possible if the case goes to trial. As such, the commission might be inclined to settle in order to keep them from the public eye.The documents in question, concern former SEC official William Hinman who gave a market-moving speech back in 2018 declaring that Ethereum was not a security because, like bitcoin, it was “sufficiently decentralized”.While some may argue that a Ripple and SEC settlement has always been a possibility, Morgan argued that it’s not merely theoretical, as the conditions for a settlement deal are actually quite good.HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ONE AND ALL."

New York-based Genesis has hired advisers to explore all possible options, including raising new funding, and will deliver a plan for its lending business next week, Islim said.The move will affect only the lending business, according to Islim, who said Genesis’s spot and derivatives trading and custody businesses “remain fully operational.”https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/crypto-brokerage-genesis-suspends-withdrawals-at-lending-arm-1.1847224#:~:text=(Bloomberg)%20%2D%2D%20Crypto%20brokerage%20Genesis,of%20the%20collapse%20of%20FTX."

2022-11-11 00:52:00,"@NancyNakamoto I have no idea what sort of distorted reality you live in at the moment but you are clearly are ignoring a lot of other facts in the SEC vs Ripple or shall I call it Ripple vs SEC at the moment? The Ripple sales have nothing to do with anything and that should also be a big question mark to yourself and any other BTC maxi. Why has the SEC not asked Ripple to stop the selling of XRP if they are so convinced of it's status? As for the dumping it on the retail market, you are again wrong as Ripple has also been buying too. You are ignoring the number of Amici motions submitted and all the use cases demonstrated by those third parties using both the XRPL and XRP without any Ripple approval or knowledge. You also seem to ignore the SEC's position and speech that good old Bill Hinman made public where some of the statements also indicate that the BTC and ETH free pass applies to XRPL too. Hence, the fair notice defence stands here as the SEC was not and is still not clear about any sort of regulation when it comes to crypto.As for how the Howie test is being applied, the SEC seem to pick and choose only a few prongs here to focus on, while ignoring the others. That law or case is clear that all the prongs need to be met and yet the SEC chooses whatever it pleases. To me this is a clear attempt to stop the blockchain and crypto space all-together.The SEC does not care one bit about the retail market but their biggest supporters, the big fat banks who stand to lose a lot if cyrpto and blockchain takes off. Well, breaking news...these last attempts to stop it will also fail, no matter how hard the banks and the SEC will fight it!"
2022-11-10 23:18:00,Very confusing market circumstances right now. Focussed on further BTC decline that will drag all alts down and trying to pinpoint at what level xrp would then sit.But there is also still this 2017/18 history when BTC nosedived and XRP did a ~ 1200% with BTC $ pouring in.....And on top of that I think XRP is still holding strong in this onslaught.....

XRPChat is essentially dead, XRP Twitter and Youtube mostly seems to be bots.but even setting aside the continuing collapse of the crypto ecosystem, the $2.5 Billion of XRP that Ripple has dumped since the court case began you cannot ignore the summary from the SEC vs LBRY case""..the SEC has based its claim on a straightforward application of a venerable Supreme Court precedent that has been applied by hundreds of federal courts across the country over more than 70 years. While this may be the first time it has been used against an issuer of digital tokens that did not conduct an ICO, LBRY is in no position to claim that it did not receive fair notice that its conduct was unlawful.""In other words the Howey test applies to crypto and you cannot use a ""Fair notice"" defence.

2022-11-08 02:18:00,"Headline on a Dutch online news site;https://www.nu.nl/economie/6234577/cryptomunten-volgens-dnb-geen-goede-vervanger-van-normaal-geld.html ""Digital currencies such as bitcoin are too risky to serve as a means of payment, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) said on Monday. There are too many and the value changes too quickly. The financial supervisor does see something in stablecoins, which are linked to the dollar, for example.Cryptocurrencies have quickly conquered an important place in the financial system. Many consumers and also companies have invested in it. Some believe that digital currencies can serve as a means of payment, just like the euro or the dollar.But DNB doesn't like that. Money is used to pay, save and calculate. But in order to fulfill those functions, a crypto coin must be stable in value and they often are not. For example, the value of bitcoin, the largest digital currency, fell from more than 40,000 dollars (40,000 euros) to 20,000 dollars in three months this spring. The coin is still worth that.Another argument of DNB is that there are many thousands of different currencies. The price of a product should therefore be given in, for example, bitcoins, ethereums, XRPs, Sols and many other currencies.There is also a lack of an organization that coordinates the market. DNB also points out that the coins have no underlying value, for example because they are not linked to a company that generates turnover.Stablecoins do have potentialDNB does make an exception for stablecoins such as Tether. Such cryptocurrencies are linked to assets, for example the dollar.The idea is that these coins are more stable and less likely to fall or rise in value. If those cryptocurrencies are properly regulated, they would offer opportunities. According to DNB, the technology behind digital currencies does have potential.""They make it possible, for example, to offer a payment platform without the intervention of traditional parties,"" says the regulator. ""Stablecoins can also contribute to cheaper cross-border payment traffic. This entails the necessary risks but also opportunities, which, however, only come into their own when supported by stable money.""""Translated with Google"

2022-11-04 22:40:00,"Why would coinbase relist XRP? They are still regulated by the SEC even though they don't agree with their policies. Would be careless and irresponsible to break the rules until there is clarity. Speaking as s a previous regulator, firms will only act upon guidance from compliance. And no compliance officer (Head of, or whatever) is going to advise the business to break the rules as the commercial risk is too great.XRP is doing what its best at. Price movement on speculation, but unless no clarity gary backs down, I dont see coinbase relisting shit until this court case is over."

That brings me to the conclusion that it's already priced in. A Coinbase relisting will give us at least some opportunity to limit damages/take some profit but after that it's done. Only worldwide massadoption of ODL can drive the price up to insane levels but I don't see that happen any time soon. But these are just thoughts of course and like many others I know nothing.....

2022-11-01 02:57:00,"Today Crypto Basis  reports:Legal Experts’ PredictionsAccording to a report written by Forbes Senior Contributor Roslyn Layton, there are signs that the SEC may suffer a “bruising defeat” against Ripple.“The verdict could drastically limit the SEC’s authority to regulate crypto in the United States. If that’s how it ends, it will have been a self-inflicted disaster from the start,” Layton wrote. The Forbes journalist quoted a statement by attorney Jeremy Hogan, who said the SEC would only prevail with its recently-filed summary judgment motion if U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres “forgets her first year in law school.” Similarly, other top legal experts, including Professor J.W. Verret of George Mason University’s Scalia School of Law and Curt Levey of the Federalist Society, think Ripple is on track to record a major victory against the SEC. Alderoty: Ripple Willing to Settle If…Despite these legal opinions, the SEC is still committed to making a scapegoat of Ripple to ensure it continues its regulation by enforcement drive in the crypto industry. Forbes also quoted the statement of Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s General Counsel recent interview in which he said Ripple is willing to settle if the SEC concludes that XRP is not a security.“If the SEC makes clear that Ripple sales and distributions of XRP and XRP trading in the secondary market does not constitute a security, if they’re willing to acknowledge that, the case settles and settles very, very quickly…, we have no choice to continue to defend the case.”"

2022-10-28 19:30:00,A huge giveaway that shows that XRP (crypto in general actually) was never meant to be owned and used by individuals is the complete absence of privacy and the ease with which you can track the address(es) used to fund the address/wallet you spend with. To keep it somewhat private you can only fund it via an Exchange (KYC) that makes it as anonymously as a bank account number. For the general public that is. If you use it to spend at a merchants website the payment will be visible and the merchants address will probably be known to the public so people can see on what kind of things you are spending money on. So be careful with sharing your address would be my advice. Even my test addresses are not safe to share bc i funded them with my actual Hodling-wallet. You can trace that back easily. If i ever hit the jackpot it's going to Fiat and feel safer spending it. For the people that already knew this by heart.... feel free to ridicule.

Ripple fans and other industry observers felt the documents would considerably bolster the company’s defense.Ripple boss Brad Garlinghouse blasted the SEC in a tweet while responding to the announcement from Stuart. Garlinghouse told his followers not to believe the agency when it claims to care about “disclosure, transparency, and clarity.”“When the truth eventually comes out, the shamefulness of their behavior here will shock you,” he summarized.Both the SEC and Ripple recently called for an immediate ruling on the lawsuit based on available evidence — without taking the case to trial. The push to end the long-standing case saw the price of XRP jump by over 40%.Just last week, the court granted amicus requests from two reputable firms to join the case and offer opinions on certain legal questions in the lawsuit."

2022-10-14 21:19:00,"My opinion about the lawsuit is this. I have no idea how long the SEC can keep a straight face in face of adversity but also in risking losing power and influence by dragging their dirty laundry in the open (Hinman, Clayton, etc). So, personally I would expect either a settlement or the judges coming up with a quick decision after Summary Judgment. The SEC tactics on delaying the lawsuit are an embarrassment for the agency along with the very thin evidence they have presented thus far in their Summary Judgment motion. I will also expect to see big price movements (on the upside, of course) before the actual lawsuit is over and that's because Ripple as company only stopped growing in the US. Outside the US jurisdiction the Ripple had an explosive growth and that can be noticed by the current valuation of their shares currently only offered pre-IPO. A win for the Ripple team will not only open the US markets for their products and subsequently for XRP being utilised as a bridge asset but also allowing Ripple the company to go public. Good luck and for all the ""die hard' holders...you will be rewarded for sure."

2022-09-18 22:45:00,"I believe by November 2022 the SEC will be looking for a quick settlement to the Ripple/XRP case.If they lose this case, and they surely will, it will have an effect on the other law suits the SEC is engaged in with other Crypto Currencies. After the mid term election the government should start a full scale investigation of the crooked actions of Mr Clayton and Mr Hinman. Both should be indited and sent to Jail. A new agency should be formed that has experience is The Crypto market so the general public can be fully protected against the likes of the SEC. that proved no such protection was not provided to XRP investors who on a whole, lost over 1 billion dollars due to the incompetence of the SEC..This will insure it will never happen again."
2022-09-18 20:23:00,I am convinced that bitcoin still has enough room to bleed and will drag xrp (among others) down with it. The worth of xrp that we all want it to be will have to come from ODL and that is still far away. But that is just my uneducated guess of course.

Does this mean the Judge now has to make a decision  on what the hell the SEC is talking about. The Judge has a multiple choice of A, B, C, D. scenarios. This is a slap in the face to the judicial system. How long will the judge put up with this SEC charade and just pull the plug on the SEC. Enough is enough. Furthermore to show how dumb this agency is, they are suing Coinbase for selling unregistered securities. Before selling XRP on their exchange, Coinbase   contacted the SEC for guidance and was given clearance to list XRP on their exchange which permitted them to sell XRP coins. Come on Judge, what more evidence do you need to throw out the lawsuit against Ripple/XRP. even a blind judge can see how unprofessional and incompetent the SEC is. Is this the governing body you want presiding over the the US Crypto exchange?"

They keep changing their position from week to week, filing extensions after extensions. The case with Ripple is on going now for two years. They keep changing the CEO's with the current CEO Gensler, who hasn't got a clue  what's the difference between a Security and a  Currency. He taught Crypto Currency at Harvard. I feel sorry for those students who were in his class.  This incompetent head of the SEC is now suing everybody and any body on the Crypto exchanges as well as the exchanges themselves. The entire world is functioning beautifully in regards to the Crypto Market, except the U.S?  I wonder why! The government should set up a special  agency with clear guidelines governing  the Crypto Market with real people with real knowledge of  how the Crypto Market functions..  After following this case closely, I find it hard to determine who the plaintiff is and who the defendants are. The SEC is operating like a defendant in this case. It should have been thrown out of the courts a long time ago.						View Edits"

The value of a unit of cash or money that is deflating or appreciating is a bitcoin. Wouldn't this bring forth a whole new set of problems by itself? If money were flawless, it wouldn't accumulate or depreciate in value, would it?In other words, in some mystical universe, the quantity of currency and money expands and contracts precisely in proportion to the growth or contraction of the population, as well as in proportion to the destruction of currency and money, thereby preserving a constant value for all time and for all eternity. Talk about a complicated calculation that is much above my capabilities, but goes ahead and do it.These are the factors that I take into consideration."

Well, what can I say. I dont yet believe the crypto winter is upon us, we are just waiting on the catalyst.Heres potential scenarios (both good and bad) on what I think could happen;Pros:1) Jed could be gone within the week. 2) Summary judgement in favour of ripple3) Settlement from SEC to avoid exposure of previous poor administration4) news of recessions, an ultimate move down for a short period before a catalyt movement for the next bull run5) the charts indicate there has been sufficient time AND capitulation for a bear market and the bull should return following the most recent capitulationCons:1) Worldwide recession and depression, leading to a run to gold and FIAT2) Summary judgement not in Ripples favour because the court system is corrupt and will not rule against another government Function.3) Recessions and global depression worse than we think and all markets sell off massively without a bounce 4) USDT collapses bringing down the whole crypto market (temporarily)5) USA regulators ban exchanges from selling crypto to the public (with the exception of BTC)Regardless as to which way we go, I'm still here with my bags fully loaded. I've bought all the way down and doubled my holding. I still have some on the sidelines and if XRP drops again I will be as greedy as a pig, loading up from savings credit and any other way I can generate FIAT.One thing I am concerned about.... we all seem to be blindsided by the fuel crisis, because whilst nobody is paying attention, the world (moreso outside the US) is running out of food. The governments and news channels arent report this and governments don't want to cause mass panic buying, but you can notice it already. I live in spain, and in my supermarkets, fridges and shelves are not just empty, the fridge units and shelves are actually disappearing completely.According to statistics europe only has less than 60 days worth of food left and very little from harvest this year...mainly due to reliance on Ukraine for wheat and grains.  I fear the food shortage is going to be deep and long and will see increases in price unlike you would ever believe. Theres no grains to feed animals, a bag of grain for my chickens has gone up 500% from March. Eggs are up 200% from March.I am slowly buying extra from the supermarket, a little extra every week to add to my stock. Im growing my own veg, and fruit, and stockpiling for the incoming food shortage. In saying that, I'm NOT going and clearing the shelves, just an extra bag of rice here and an extra can of beans there. Try and build up a 3 month supply. I think this will be very important. Do it slowly, over a number of weeks. Canned food, dried grains, pulses, flour. All these things are going to become scarce. You can't eat money.Whatever way we are going, the crazy World of crypto usually means to expect the opposite of what every else expects.... remember covid 19 ""the end of the world"" we sank to 11 cents then rose to 1.80 over the coming months. Not all bad news is bad and not all good news is good. We are MISSING the alts season. I dont believe we can move on without an let's season.... its there, waiting, waiting for you to sell, testing your nerve and patience. Good luck to all.						View Edits"

The final details are broadly similar to the proposal issued last year.The Board confirmed that the new message format, ISO 20022, will be adopted on a single day as proposed last year, rather than in three separate phases. The Board also provided a new timeline for implementation based on review of public comments, with the new message format to be adopted on March 10, 2025. In addition, the Board provided further information regarding customer testing and other implementation details.The Fedwire Funds Service is a real-time gross settlement system owned and operated by the Federal Reserve Banks, which enables businesses and financial institutions to transfer funds quickly and securely. Adopting the new message format for the Fedwire Funds Service will allow for enhanced efficiency of both domestic and cross-border payments due to greater interoperability among global payment systems, and a richer set of payment data that may help banks and other entities comply with sanctions and anti-money laundering requirements. The new message format is an industry standard that many global payment and messaging systems are adopting.The new message format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization, which is an independent, non-governmental organization that publishes standards for a broad range of industries.For media inquiries, e-mail media@frb.gov or call 202-452-2955.Federal Register notice: New Message Format for the Fedwire Funds Service (PDF)Last Update: June 27, 2022BOARD OF GOVERNORS of the FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM"

2022-06-24 18:52:00,Sometimes it is very hard and terrifying to stick to your plan/expectations. Too many tokens across the board that show the same/much more substantial growth at the moment to make this specific to XRP. Also the fact that in bear markets there are always them 'reliefs' that trick you in hopping back on the bandwagon (chasing green candles). Sure hope my gut is right and huge selloff is on the way....

Watchdog is challenging the submitted records as they have the original records. The SEC is trying every trick in the book according to Watchdog  to slant the Hinman e-mails in their favor. I feel the Judge is a smart cookie and will not fall to the SEC. Bullshit. In today's leftist times too many tricks have occurred in the court system.

Coinbase wasn't too bad as they just disable 2fa on request and a few other pains. Bitrue asked for everything but dick length and I'm still waiting. It's a pain. Do yourself a favor and have 2FA software on a backup device.

This should get a rise  out of Bitshit which has been used as a hedge against inflation in the past. XRP rallied over $0.34 this morning then the vultures came in and dropped it to a little over $0.31. Once the results come in on the court case which is awaiting the result of the judges ruling on the Hinman speech and e-mail documents the pump should begin.

They will have to move to either drop the case or try to  work out a settlement with Ripple.  This will enable them to pursue other lawsuits against other Crypto coins.

Ripple CaseOn December 22nd, 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs and two of its executives for offering illegal securities. However, the case looks likely to swing in favor of Ripple.Although Ripple has countered the SEC’s claims, the securities agency has been accused of employing delay tactics to stall the lawsuit’s conclusion. However, Judge Analisa Torres appears to be done with the delays as she wants a verdict reached as soon as possible.SEC Vs. Ripple Case to End this YearAttorney James K. Filan, a former U.S. prosecutor, shared a “pleasant surprise” in response to the Joint Schedule order letter written by the SEC and Ripple. While it looked certain that the lawsuit was destined to drag on into 2023, Judge Torres has ruled that motions for the judgement summary must be fully briefed by November 15th, 2022.Responding to the news, Jeremy Hogan, a Hogan & Hogan law firm partner, opined that Judge Torres “wants the Ripple v. SEC case over before Christmas.”"

If they drag the case out to 2023 and further, the SEC could appeal the court ruling in favor of Ripple,  then appeal the  case the the Higher Court, which will add more years. The only tool the SEC has is the stall. They are killing the price and potential clients who will use other avenues for their money transferring. Best to lose a battle and win the war. The SEC is just looking to cover their asses and regain a little crooked creditably they have always had. Brad is trying to spank them and spank them hard.

2022-04-19 22:00:00,"I did some research and found out that xrp is not used very often for payments abroad.. ripple uses x current or rapid.. so my question is what is the purpose of xrp?Every crypto investor must learn to distinguish between Ripple the company, the Ripple network, the protocols and the Ripple XRP cryptocurrency.  The company Ripple develops the Ripple network for financial institutions by offering the Ripple xCurrent software.  This software is about achieving superior interoperability between the various existing digital ledgers of banks.  The protocol uses the InterLedger Protocol (ILP) to transfer fiat currency (such as the US Dollar) to a bank in Japan in Japanese Yen in a cheap and super fast way from a bank in Korea for minimal conversion costs.  Only 1 transaction processing is required.  This xCurrent software does not use the Ripple XRP cryptocurrency.  It's optional.  The company Ripple will of course try as much as possible to promote the internal XRP cryptocurrency at banks and financial institutions.  Ripple will do this with another software solution, the xRapid, which also uses the ILP and XRP and is developed for international payment processors such as MoneyGram and Western Union.  Here, XRP the cryptocurrency will be used more for transferring often relatively small transactions of lesser foreign currencies.  xRapid will also be able to be used for general crypto exchanges or Ripple exchanges.  Bitrex, Coins.ph and Bitso will use xRapid.						View Edits"

One big piece of evidence that Ripple wants admitted to trial is a transcript of SEC official William Hinman saying that cryptocurrencies aren’t securities. The SEC is trying to prove that Ripple Labs conducted an unregistered securities offering. If XRP isn’t a security, then there is no way that Ripple labs could have done what is being claimed. And we’ve got written records of SEC bigwigs saying that cryptocurrencies aren’t securities. The SEC wanted the statements to this effect excluded from trial. Unfortunately for them, Ripple’s lawyers moved to strike those motions, and the judge agreed. So now Ripple gets to use the SEC official’s statements against the SEC in court.arch 30th 2022 Court Case News:"

2022-03-22 06:33:00,I could be wrong but the Judges rulings today is a two edged sword. We win on fair notice but judge won't throw out the SEC's suit against Brad and Lersen. What I am reading between the lines The securities portion of  the case we win then SEC fines Brad and Larsen for knowingly selling securities and gets fined. This enables the SEC to save face by winning a partial decision. All this B.S. could have be hacked out long ago. The crooked government got to the judge to order a split decision. Only my Gut Feeling.						View Edits

Especially the participants that are more than transparent but go over to the SEC and ask how to be compliant.

2022-03-16 23:36:00,"In the never ending battle of Good( Ripple) and Evil( SEC) The Crooked SEC has now filed a petition  stating the e-mails and documents from 2018 should not be allowed as they have no connection with the suit against Brad and Larsen. The judge will now await Ripple's counter before she makes her decision. If she rules against Ripples motion, all indications would be the Government got after the Judge to changer her stance in the case. It would be like winning a heavy weight title bout after Ripple has won all 11 rounds. With 15 second left in the 12th round the ref. stops the fight due to a scratch on the bridge of the nose of Ripple. On the flip side  if the judge rules in favor of Ripple, The SEC must provide the E-mails that would totally sink their case. The SEC should then drop the case or the judge should dismiss it.I have been around the block too many times, not to smell a rat. I hope I am wrong and  JUSTICE PREVAILS.						View Edits"

He claims the SEC is cracking down on companies like Tesla for Insider trading.  Just look inside the crooked, corrupt SEC. When Hinmann and former CEO Clayton are just as  guilty of Insider trading. Both left the SEC for cushie jobs in an  investment firm that is heavily involved with ETH. When the SEC gave ETH clearence by declaring them as a currency and not a Security ETH went from $50.00 to $1,400 shortly after. Clayton files a law suit against Ripple/XRP with one foot out the door going to his new job with the investment company along with Hinmann.  What a coincidence Ripple/XRP is a competitor of ETH. The whole world knows the Crooked SEC can not  win this case. JUDGE TORRES.What are you waiting for. The facts are the facts just act upon them and throw this case out so we investors get satisfaction for all the financial damage the SEC has caused us. They are only trying to drag out the case at the cost of us investors who they are supposed to protect. What a Joke!"

SGB will be obsolete once FLR is launched and that's going to happen soon.So I figure I could get a nice big bag of Shib as a little gamble and see what happens. even if it hit 1 cent id make a decent return, so I feel I have nothing to lose and everything to gain.Anyone have any thoughts on my idea??Oh yeah and every time I try to send my VGB from my ledger it continues to fail.

2022-03-01 01:49:00,"I copied this from a site U.K Government Accelerates Reform Plans Amid Russia’s Invasion of UkrainePer the report, the reforms will be contained under a new economic crime bill. This bill is directly aimed at tackling the criminal use of digital currencies today, including money laundering, terrorism funding, among other illicit activities that might be related to crypto transactions.Though, this legislation has been in the works for a while now, it didn’t initially have much mass appeal. However, seeing as the Russian invasion of Ukraine has raised more concerns about the possible flow of ‘dirty money’ into the U.K. and everywhere else, the reforms are probably more than necessary.Financial Times claims that ministers will soon publish a white paper proposing the reforms to the Companies House. That is the U.K.’s registrar, where all businesses have to submit their financial statements and other necessary documents. And as contained in the reforms, applicants registering new companies must provide a well-detailed identity report.Meanwhile, this new bill is being proposed alongside a similar economic crime bill. For the latter, the legislation is that there should be sone kind of register of overseas entities. This means that all foreign owners of companies are required to reveal their identities. By this, criminals can be prevented from using shell companies to hide funds whilst doing illegal business."

According to the SEC, BIAs are securities but were not registered as such. The agency further alleges that BlockFi ""overstated the degree to which it secured protection from defaults by institutional borrowers through collateral."" In short, it purportedly said most of its loans were over-collateralized when they weren't.The firm must pay a $50 million penalty to the SEC, $50 million in fines to 32 states, stop registering new accounts, and meet the requirements of the Investment Company Act within 60 days. It neither admitted nor denied the agency's charges. BlockFi is putting a positive spin on things, saying it will register with the SEC and roll out a new offering that will help clear up regulatory questions for similar products: ""We intend for BlockFi Yield to be a new, SEC-registered crypto interest-bearing security, which will allow clients to earn interest on their crypto assets.”Open and closed…moving on🤷‍♂️…xrp, over year has gone by and all shit as far as I’m concerned…these delays are allowing xrp to lose ground in crypto land…oh, and 🖕Hugo with his flare.

Ripple has filed a motion to compel the SEC to hand over notes taken at a meeting between its CEO and a former SEC commissioner. What is the judge waiting for to order the SEC to turn over the notes which would be a home run for Ripple. In addition how long will she wait to receive the 1000 pages of documents she ordered the SEC to produce ? If both are not produced by Feb 18th she should pull the plug on this case . Congress should then step in and order a full  criminal investigation against the SEC and the  previous CEO.s and Hinnman.  Collusion and fraud are as obvious as night and day!!						View Edits

By the end of the press conference, Dow was down by negative 410 points, Nasdaq was down by negative 470 points and BTC fell to $ 37,131.

The PWG report also notes, however, that the potential for the increased use of stablecoins as a means of payment raises a range of concerns related to the potential for destabilizing runs, disruptions in the payment system, and concentration of economic power. The PWG report highlights gaps in the authority of regulators to reduce these risks. To address the risks of payment stablecoins, the PWG report recommends that Congress act promptly to enact legislation that would ensure payment stablecoins and payment stablecoin arrangements are subject to a consistent and comprehensive federal regulatory framework. Such legislation would complement existing authorities regarding market integrity, investor protection, and illicit finance"

For most people, it is a large figure However, if you condensed 7.8 billion into 100 persons, and then into various percentage statistics the resulting analysis is relatively much easier to comprehend. Out of 100 : 11 are in Europe 5 are in North America 9 are in South America 15 are in Africa 60 are in Asia 49 live in the countryside 51 live in cities 75 have mobile phones 25 do not. 30 have internet access 70 do not have the availability to go online 7 received university education 93 did not attend college. 83 can read 17 are illiterate. 33 are Christians 22 are Muslims 14 are Hindus 7 are Buddhists 12 are other religions 12 have no religious beliefs. 26 live less than 14 years 66 died between 15 - 64 years of age 8 are over 65 years old. If you have your own home, Eat full meals & drink clean water, Have a mobile phone, Can surf the internet, and have gone to college, You are in the miniscule privileged lot. (in the less than 7% category) Amongst 100 persons in the world, only 8 live or exceed the age of 65. If you are over 65 years old, be content & grateful. Cherish life, grasp the moment. If you did not leave this world before the age of 64 like the 92 persons who have gone before you, you are already the blessed amongst mankind. Take good care of your own health.

2022-01-10 00:10:00,"Closing statement from Coin Pedia article  found in CC News:Will The Voice Of The XRP Army Go Unheard?Jeremy Hogan in a series of tweets cites that, in the Fife case the defendants tried to argue “Fair Notice” in order to dismiss the lawsuit, which failed. Because the burden was pretty high on a party moving to strike a pleading.On the other hand, the Ripple case is very different from the Fife case. As it is the SEC that has been attempting to strike the affirmative defense of fair notice, and it has a burden to meet.Renowned American journalist believes 2022 will likely be the biggest narrative in the crypto industry, with the Ripple’s legal brawl terminating. He cites that Ripple’s triumph will cease SEC’s power over the crypto industry.While SEC’s win could result in the commission going after Ethereum. On the contrary, the XRP army has been voicing for Joe Rogan’s podcast with John Deaton as a guest.Summing up, although the move by SEC is a major and notable one in retaliation against Ripple. In legal terms, it holds little value, as both the cases are distinct in their own terms.Moreover, the jurisdiction considers evidence over speculations, and verdicts of other cases. Therefore, the filing has little to worry about, and the next hearing could be pivotal in the future of the legal brawl."

On the other hand, the XRP community is looking forward to backing from Tesla co-founder Elon Musk. As the XRP community and Elon Musk share similar dislikes in interest."

2021-12-15 00:19:00,Coinbase has  just come out with a statement they will implement their LEND PROGRAM. It is roughly a 5% interest program. A FEW MONTHS AGO THE CROOKED SEC. notified them they would be in violation of the SEC regulatory codes. Coinbase backed off.  Coinbase is now getting balls and is challenging the SEC by coming out with the LEND program anyway. Coinbase might be realizing how incompetent the SEC is by going ahead with their program defying the SEC. They also stated a few months ago they were behind Ripple/XRP. If they went this far with the SEC. the next step is to continue their challenge by re-listing XRP on their exchange. A POSSIBILITY?

Ripple should pick up their marbles and just move the entire operation out of the U.S crooked, government controlled country. Screw the SEC!

Sorry folks... think we're all feeling a little butt sore this morning.**************************************************1 month ago Captain-jack commented on a post in the XRP coin forum.I've been waiting for 0.72 for weeks. Im not sure I'm gonna get 0.72 but im just getting myself in a position ready to buy..... with the current volume all the exchanges will lock up if the market shits right now....im just trying to figure where to put my buy order. I've been 25% out since 1.40. But where is it going to go? That is the question. I feel sure its going to happen tonight. In next hour or so						View Edits"

2021-12-04 06:49:00,The best advice right now is to just forget about XRP wait 4 months and evaluate from there.  Short term the SEC is playing with everyones emotions. Gary Gensler thinks he is the shit! What goes around comes around and the SEC will implode.  Dont forget you cant keep a new INNOvation down for long because this is the new ERA.

2021-12-02 04:03:00,Sologenics is at $4.6If the air drop really gives us 0.2 SOLO to 1 XRP.  Well that would make the solo airdrop tokens worth almost more than my XRP holdings lol

2021-11-25 10:42:00,"Ok, so I got bored and decided to create a website called the ""xrp lottery"".  The concept and process was relatively simple; willing participants would send a 1 xrp transaction to a wallet, and every Friday night at 23:00 EDT a random transaction would be selected to win the pot.  The whole process was clearly documented including the randomize formula being used for the lottery when selecting the winning transaction, how the XRP would be transferred, etc.  I provided links to the XRPL wallet, an FAQ page outlining the risks (essentially everyone will lose except for the winner), and even a rules and Terms of Service page - oh, and gambling addiction links.  I knew it would be difficult trying to convince people that it wasn't a scam, but I thought it would be a fun way to show XRPs utility, transparency, speed, etc.  The day after I completed the website it gets taken down.  It was reported as a scam (even though I never had a chance to prove that it wasn't) by a company hired by Ripple to identify fraudulent sites and take them down.  What's more interesting though was their wording:  ""This domain is illegally using the XRP Ripple brand's trademarked name in its website and hosting a fake page that is involved in scamming the user by providing giveaways on their website. This creates confusion among our client's customers.""I found it interesting that they stated ""the XRP Ripple brand's trademarked name"".  This wasn't actually true, as the only ripple anything on the webpage was the ticker symbol in the top left hand corner of this page.  I wrote the guy back and explained that Ripple and XRP were two separate things - along with some other choice words.The web host seems to be leaning my way and is prepared to relist the website, but they want a ton of personal information: passport, phone bill, business registration, tax bill, etc.  I'm thinking it's not worth it, as I hate giving out too much personal information.   Any thoughts here?"

2021-11-13 22:16:00,Greetings from Copenhagen! 🇩🇰 fucking beer is mega expensive here....i also forgot my jacket.
2021-11-13 21:42:00,"Hey all, I have not written a post here in a while and I think it is time to do so as the end of this year approaches fast. Hope everyone is safe and well with this pandemic still around and which sadly took with it a few friends and people I knew. I have been silently reading the posts here for a while but chose to stay quiet waiting for this joke of a trial to end or get settled. Of course this is now dragging on as the ETH folks have major interests in the same banking system the BTC crowd wishes to see gone and this way, the bankers get to brag that blockchain is now used in their services. However, no one is asking at what cost (see ETH and BTC fees), environmental or the unlimited print of ETH (the new FED). Yet, all the uninformed people are still calling XRP , the banker's coin. Maybe those people should really look into that a bit more and understand how ETH and BTC is doing a much better job at that. Due to this absurd trial and the claims the SEC have put forward the price of XRP is and had been suppressed and that's of course not a surprise given these circumstances. However, Ripple has made huge strides and increased their business outside the US, contrary to everyone's belief that no one will do business with them. To the contrary, Ripple is now having a huge marketing awareness/marketing campaign not only in the US but globally because of this trail and that's a good thing. Any press is still good press and when this trial will end with Ripple's victory, the price explosion will be monumental. The end of the trial will not be the only reason to see a price discovery for this asset but with regulatory clarity, huge partnerships will start to be made public. In the background the adoption of ODL and Ripple's products has been fantastic outside of the US and with clarity we will see the same happening on the continent too. To me personally, the end of the trial will also signify the beginning of the end for the speculation phase of the crypto market. Good luck if you're still holding and buying as of course nothing is certain in this market but personally I have no doubt that we will see huge rewards and we'll have the last laugh ;-)						View Edits"

2021-11-10 03:01:00,BTC will drag us back to $0.5 in January. The extension of the discovery phase is a killer for XRP.
2021-11-09 19:12:00,"Do you think that in the worst case, Ripple only needs a settlement with the SEC? Sorry, the SEC will never accept a deal with Ripple. A regulator always has more than one way to win a lawsuit it initiates."
2021-11-09 18:54:00,give us the fucking $2 at least!
2021-11-09 18:47:00,"TruthYou say xrp is a fast and cheap money transfer solution?Are not? it only happens on the Ripple network. But the user transfer process is much more complicated and risky than Ripple claims.First, they have to pay a fee to transfer fiat to the exchange to buy XRP at the seller's high price - the purchase fee. They then need to send their xrp to the exchange that is open in the country they need - the transfer fee. The recipient has to face the risk of the bid/ask spread. What if the price increases after receiving (congratulations) but what if it decreases? You have to sell at a loss or hold for the right time, the more you hold, the less you hold, and instead of transferring money, you are misappropriated capital. And when you sell, you have to pay for the exchange, and there's an extra fee to move around.In short, you spend too much money to transfer and convert, face the buying / selling price difference and the risk of losing more and more.So what is the benefit of Ripple? That is they allocate xrp to exchanges for what they call: responding to market liquidity.So what are the benefits of exchanges? They create xrp pumps and dumps to trap money transfers for maximum profit.What does the money sender get? Want to quickly sell at a loss and spend a lot of intermediary fees.So is it cheap?"
2021-11-09 13:43:00,"TruthSec is taking advantage of the legal battle with Ripple to perfect the regulations on the management of the cryptocurrency system. Disputes, reasons for lawsuits, evidence collection, arguments are always good materials for SEC's lawyers to develop regulations to submit to the US government. The battle lasts until the US government approves the contents to regulate the cryptocurrency market of Sec, At that time, there is definitely no agreement here, no more lawsuits here, Conviction and punishment.The US government will listen to its management agency. They never accept an autonomous bank like Ripple, Turning billions of XRP into billions of dollars in their inability to compete with banking systems that share core interests with the US government.The US government never accepted Ripple as the flagship of a successful monetary revolution, leading to hundreds of similar models forming and overthrowing the financial system that has existed for hundreds of years in the US. .The US government is increasingly realizing the great benefits and great risks in managing the cryptocurrency market when there are many organizations that own large amounts of cash, billionaires, and influential individuals. People and millions of Americans are changing their investment taste every day."
2021-11-09 08:12:00,"Judge Netburn granted the SEC’s Motion to Compel Ripple to search for and turn over video and audio recordings of internal Ripple meetings.  But the Order had limitations as described below.  Judge Netburn ruled as follows: “Ripple's search of its recorded meetings has been inadequate under the circumstances. While the Court recognizes that a human review of the recordings may be unreasonable, a reasonable search could include automated transcriptions of recordings (similar to the common technology used to transcribe voicemail messages) and the use of search terms. Accordingly, Ripple is ORDERED to conduct a reasonable search of the relevant video and audio-taped recordings and produce responsive documents. Because Ripple represents that it has more than 4,000 recordings, the parties are ORDERED to meet and confer to determine whether there are particular time periods when recordings are most likely to be responsive to the SEC's discovery demands. For example, meetings in the weeks preceding dates of significance may generate more probative material than meetings held at other times. Similarly, cross-references with the calendars for the Individual Defendants or other key employees may identify meetings of significance.  In light of the close of discovery, Ripple is order[ed] to undertake such efforts without delay.”   It was a Text Only Order issued today."

2021-10-30 20:32:00,"Summary of airdrops for XRP holders:Basically there are 2 groups of airdrops.Group 1: Songbird/Canary, token name SBG. SGB has already been airdropped. Those who currently hold SGB will get another airdrop of EXFI. Snapshot on 5th November.Group 2: Spark/Flare, token name is FLR. Snapshot was in Dec 2020. Token will be airdropped later. Then comes more snapshots of FLR holdings and more airdrops likes governance tokens for Flare Finance etc.Both these groups are issued by the same company called Flare finance. SGB is the experimental version of FLR. So new and advanced financial products will be first issued in the SGB group (like decentralised insurance, mutual funds etc) and when it works without problems, it will come to FLR group. Thats why we have the SGB token airdrop first as issues will be rectified and then we get the FLR. I expect SGB to be worth more as new products will come there first.Best wallet for Flare Finance and its tokens is Bifrost. Once downloaded you can use the same secret words from your metamask wallet (for people who did self custody) to retrieve the original wallet and the airdrops.P.S: Don’t forget to stake your SGB tokens. I am currently staking on Bifrost and get 1% rewards EVERY WEEK.						View Edits"

If the US wants to do biz w ripple we should charge them triple.  This is insane and very frustrating. Sec does not give a dam about US investors.

There's no pressure, drama or hassle in SGB. Its actually fun playing with it and seeing my SGB portfolio grow every week without me spending any money on it....Think about it this way... When XRP was sitting at .50 how much were you buying on a weekly basis every Saturday morning?

Tell me I am wrong!!!!!!With this I have done nothing other than spend 30 seconds on my phone unwrapping, re wrapping and delegating and in 2 weeks have earned 220 dollars with estimated 120 dollars this week. put that estimation over 4 weeks and I am looking at 460 dollars per month passive income for doing 2 minutes finger clicking....Now tell me you have been investing 460 bucks every month into XRP from your own bank account and tell me the % rewards you have gained on that through XRP...Do you see the point in having SGB now!!"

I know many think the judges are in the SEC pocket, but I truly don't and I believe they are honest and they know this is a world breaking landmark case and its going to make their careers.

2021-09-30 15:57:00,many people are sceptic on XRP but it's going to recover and grow after the dispute with SEC is settled
2021-09-30 14:08:00,"Good morning All. I will start a new post in response to Captain Jack and some of the points made within his post..Most people keep their XRP and other assets on Ledger Nanos. I do and I have never had any issues... Was my data sold to A N Other? probably and to be honest I don't give a fuck!!!All my XRP are still there and as such I received a shit ton of FLR on the snapshot (or will do when they go live in a few weeks) and I received a pretty healthy bag of SGB. I am looking at a very tidy sum of money on my Bifrost wallet which was and ill say this out loud.... GIVEN TO ME FOR FUCKING FREE.... So Insomniac I don't get your point that you couldn't give a shit about the airdrops and SGB doesn't interest you.. I would say your talking utter bollocks with that statement. (Not looking for an argument, Id say the same to my best mates) I don't care how much money you have or how great you are as a trader... FREE MONEY IS FREE MONEY don't tell me that doesn't interest you!!Captain Jack I feel for you buddy I really do. I think its disgusting you aren't receiving your SGB, all exchanges withholding what is rightfully yours should be forced by law to give you your tokens. Also I totally believe the FLR tokens will be distributed when the network is launched, that can only happen when its safe to do so. I also think it will be done in conjunction with the ripple lawsuit being settled as the two will work hand in hand.I truly believe that combined XRP and FLR are going to explode and all of the doubters will have to eat their words!!!I would say with all the public attention on the exchanges and the now heightened media coverage of the lawsuit and these airdrops, exchanges will have to capitulate and release your allotted tokens.So Captain if my post seems a little contrived or boasty then I apologize and you are more than welcome to eat my child, to be honest you are welcome to as she's a pain in my ass anyways....."
2021-09-30 08:35:00,"On the snapshot date last year I moved all my XRP onto binance before moving it back to my separate wallets and safestores because my theory was that out of all of the exchanges, I expected binance (the biggest) to be likely the most ""reliable"" for the snapshot.I have never owned a ledger as i don't trust or want to use them. And given their scammy workers then going onto steal everyone's data ransoming their private details then dumping the whole data hoist for public pickings, I was happy I made the right decision.BUTWill we ever get any of these elusive songspark flarebirds? Or was this just another piracy hoax by another load of horseshit, aimed to privelege a few lucky ones along the way?I'm so fed up, sick and tired of the games and u-turned policiesNo smart-ass ""I'm on ledger and I got mine already"" comments ---otherwise I will eat your children!!!.

In retaliation Coinbase should lift the restriction on sales of XRP which they said would not happen until the trial is over between SEC and Ripple/XRP. Millions of dollars were lost  by both XRP and Coinbase due to the restriction. Ripple has to go all the way now fighting this injustice to the very end in the courts.

2021-09-04 00:55:00,"The SEC should throw in the towel before the 12th round of this one sided heavy weight battle. There is no way they can win the case. If they insist on drawing the case out in the courts and lose, this would hurt them immensely if they intend on making a case against any other Crypto Currency in the future.  As the Good Book says, ""Your Sins will find you out."" All the crooked dealings with Bitshit and Eth.  where the SEC gave them clearance by deeming them  as a currency and not a security, bit them in the A--. XRP fell in the same category as both coins and should have been deemed a currency a long time ago. The knockout punch will be when the SEC has to turn over their employee records that will show there were no restrictions on their employees from purchasing XRP, as many did. The new head honcho of the Sec should just drop the case to save face as he was not involved in the initial law suit against Ripple. Everyone agrees there has to be standard regulations for the  Crypto industry however, it has to be universal......"

By Mid September back in court with SEC  round 12. The Judges card will read Ripple 120 points Ripple to SEC. 0. The price will then be knocking at the $2.00 door.

Ripple's lawyer stated he will submit his rebuttal most likely in less than a week after they review the SEC report. It looks like the longer it goes, Ripple keeps piling up rounds. Currently the scores looks like 11 rounds to none, with the SEC needing a knockout in the 12th round, which is not going to happen. They should try to save  what little face they have left and settle the case. Ripple has exposed the SEC for what it is, a do nothing for the public organization."

Some do their own scientific research, and then there's some that truly don't give a fuck!!!!!What ever category you are, there's no reason to be abusive or rude to each other. Personally I have had 2 shots felt extremely unwell for 7 hours, 24 hours after receiving my 2nd shot and that was it!!! Is covid a real thing.... Yeah of course it is, is it as bad as the worlds governments and the news and social media are saying.... I am seriously in my own head starting to doubt anything they say!!!We all see it different and we all have or have not had the vaccine for our own reasons and convictions or maybe like me because I am forced to if I want to be able to do anything at all here in QATAR.

2021-08-18 11:02:00,Got out of my recent DOGE adventure with a 12% profit and will sell 1/2 of my xrp stash if it gets to $1.-- . New responsibility's came into my life with the recent sudden passing of  my dear stepmom. My father is devastated by it and his income will not be enough to sustain the house they were living in. The financial concerns are not immediate but will arrive eventually and i want to be able to offer a helping hand if needed. So i will not allow myself that my profits go under a certain level to perhaps stay there for many months/years to come..

All older blockchains have speed, scalability and gas issues.For that reason I have invested in Marlin protocol with its native token $Pond (you can buy it on binance).$Pond/ Marlin is one of the few layer-0 projects focussed on network layer optimizations.Marlin is an open protocol that provides a high-performance programmable network infrastructure for DeFi and Web 3.0.It can scale and it can make all blockchains more scalable and 500 times fasters at low gas fees.It is a matter of time before it will get integrated in most blockchains.Don't want to shill but I want to share this unique utility project for XRP investors (who have a brain).If you like it you can find more info here https://morioh.com/p/68594fd3911f.If you don't like it, please ignore this post.

From May 2017 to December 2020, senior SEC official William Hinman reportedly participated in the SEC’s regulation of cryptocurrencies while receiving millions of dollars from his former employer, the law firm Simpson Thacher. Simpson Thacher is a part of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, an industry organization whose objective is to drive the use of Enterprise Ethereum. Hinman, while in his capacity at the SEC, declared that the Ethereum cryptocurrency, Ether, was not a security, causing its value to rise significantly.  Later, the SEC sued one of Ethereum’s competitors, Ripple, declaring its cryptocurrency, XRP, was a security. Shortly thereafter, XRP’s value plummeted 25%. After Hinman left the SEC in December of 2020, he returned to Simpson Thacher as a partner. The leader of the SEC division that brought the XRP lawsuit, Marc Berger, similarly left the SEC for Simpson Thacher.Additionally, there are potential concerns regarding former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton’s handling of cryptocurrency issues at SEC.  As with Mr. Hinman and Ether, while at the SEC, Mr. Clayton declared that Bitcoin wasn’t a security, and its value rose. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple was filed at the end of Mr. Clayton’s tenure at the commission. Once he left the SEC, Mr. Clayton joined One River Asset Management, a cryptocurrency hedge fund exclusively focused on Bitcoin and Ether.If you have first-hand information you’d like to disclose to assist Empower Oversight with these inquiries, please contact us confidentially here.pdf SEC FOIA - https://empowr.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-12-JF-to-SEC-FOIA.pdfdancing banana emojis welcome						View Edits"

2021-08-14 04:32:00,Gensler knows the SEC is trying to destroy Ripple by delaying the outcome.  So they have to pay the counsel large fees for extending this circus.  SEC is known for suing companies get a quick settlement becuz they cant afford attorneys to represent them.  This is corruption at best.  Someone needs to step in and stop this .  Although Ripple can win this if and when we go to trial.  But Gary steps in last minute and throws the red flag to contest and tries to settle.  Gensler stated they never lose a case.  Guess what Gary there is always a first time for everything.  you overstepped your boundaries my friend. !!!!!

2021-07-29 18:53:00,"Question for UK people only. About when it comes to sell and our ""exit plans"" now the regulators on both sides of the pond have fucked us over.So recently the regulatory authorities supposed to ""protect"" their citizens in both the US and UK have actually made things 10x worse for people in the UK.As XRP is being dragged through the neverending legal maze of the American courts system by the SEC, this means that people in the UK cannot buy or sell XRP on coinbase(pro) as it is delisted. Then as the FCA in the UK have outright banned binance, people in the UK were still able to withdraw GBP but now that function has also been taken away. So we cannot sell xrp for gbp and cash out.How the hell are we supposed to get our money out? Or to position the question better, what is the most cost effective route to wothdraw our funds?Surely this cannot be to sell xrp for another coin (say eth for example) then transfer to coinbase and sell the other coin to cash out. This is going to eat away massively at profits from paying the fees. I need a new exit plan. The regulators here to protect me have rendered me being unable to withdraw my funds.						View Edits"

2021-07-21 09:55:00,"Zdz, I believe is correct. This is the classic bear turn that follows the same slow steps down after previous bullruns. I see btc hitting 12k, possibly lower to 6k or less, but 12k will be a resistance level. If trends continue, a couple of years bouncing around the lows before another run, which may not even happen. But who knows? This market doesn't run on fundamentals, logic nor reasoning. No coins have any tangible value..no assets or cashflow. They have no backing except for speculation, which is fueled by fomo, its nothing more than gambling. How this relates to xrp is simple: the idea of a token to bypass the slower SWIFT system for x border transactions is a nice idea. But to think that the international banking community WON'T simply create their own blockchain system is, frankly, ignorant and naive. Xrp will have its place in smaller markets, economies that don't digitalise their currencies, for whatever reasons. That will be about it. BTC is likely to become irrelevant and will fade into obscurity, along with most of the current crop of BC tokens. Not overnight, but fade. No one is genuinely investing in tokens with the intention to use them. They are investing as a gamble: to make returns. Its a ponzi scheme we have been playing..relying on ppl prepared to pay more than we did to keep prices going up. My two cents."

For me the last month was the worst period in the last five years. Many of our clients closed the businesses and people complain about lack of money. I think the whole economy is changing and it looks like the beginning of the next economic crash. I am afraid it will also have an impact on the cryptosphere. Any thoughts or similar experience?

But I think UK binance account holders holders should take serious note. https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/consumer-warning-binance-markets-limited-and-binance-groupBINANCE Futures and CFDs to be banned in UK. It may also be worth derisking if you hold balances on binance and moving to a wallet. I've just moved some coins around. Althoigh binance is a Chinese company but is now based in Hong Kong, they could at any given moment freeze UK assets and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Its unlikely they would just freeze UK assets but its also worth just derisking. I don't trust binance at all and I never have. Not one bit. And it would just be our luck after all the shit we went through with the SEC for us to then lose what we have on binance. Just to reiterate. I dont believe FCA will freeze binance accounts, I think they will likely just ban futures. But Binance could retaliate. And we know what the Chinese are like. Also Trust wallet is part of binance so be careful where you transfer your balances to.						View Edits"

It doesn’t mean that the asset itself necessarily has to be a security.

Crypto has moved on so much now and will be integrated into the world banking system sooner rather than later that's definite.I will sit happily and wait for my ship to come in. Keep the faith my fellow XRP holders keep the faith....
2021-06-22 14:37:00,"So even íf this is the start of another multi-year bear market, some top altcoins like IOTA didn’t even come close to their ATH yet this run. Not just XRP. Quite strange. The sentiment is down the drain, the news is bad (apparently China is back at it again) and soon we’ll have blood on the street. In any case, it doesn’t feel like this market cycle has seen a significant buying climax and euphoria yet. The forum here is still filled with the same members of three years ago, or which 99% of them were new then. I get it, we’re under pressure if the SEC but arguably the case is only temporary and looking quite positive for a long term outcome in terms of regulatory clarity.At the same time the charts are looking horrible and all technicals are falling apart. Once again BTC is in the lead, but alts are following closely in an amplified fashion. I haven’t yet secured a lot of fiat this past bull phase because we didn’t even come close to my projected levels, and I feel disappointed right now, but well my investment/ return horizon is up to two decades and beyond so time will be my friend again. But 2021 isn’t over yet. XRP hadn’t had an ATH yet. BTC hasn’t seen 100K yet. The SEC case isn’t finished yet. XRP isn’t deemed a non-security yet. We’ll see."

Who knows. Jun is always bad for business unless you sell holiday packages. I didn't sell above $1.5 so I won't sell now. Weak hands need to sell now and buy above $1.

2021-06-21 00:41:00,with all the negativity surrounding XRP I am not surprise to see the price back below $0.7. I wouldn't buy it at this stage and at the current price. In January one could buy it at $0.25. There is no much development. The SEC trial will last for long. The short ALT season showed us that every coin but XRP can pump. If we experience another bull run on alt coins in September most likely XRP won't pump due to the SEC trial. Something very unexpected needs to happen in order for the situation to change.

(""DA5""), has opened up direct operational payment distribution channels to service the Vietnam market by way of API integration with FinFan - Vietnam's largest provider of global remittance services.During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, FinFan became the first neo-banking institution in Vietnam to utilize the Ripple XRP blockchain network and its global financial payments network called RippleNet. As part of RippleNet, which comprises more than 300 financial institutions worldwide, FinFan, in conjunction with the partnership, carved out a more transparent solution for on-demand minimized transaction fees, with a real-time bridge between the multi-currency exchange, that could be instantly settled in the destination countries on a 24/7 basis - it is to this FinFan infrastructure that DA5 and the Lynx Pan-Global Network now has full access.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lynx-global-launches-da5-australia-070500146.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADnfVoM8LXJ45SLOwcuX60EEuf0tvQKRadU1J4G1n4pSqrz4EJTQ4MohiAdtvxxyD_s7YjkJFqmOr9lutWiulvGJuNdmQXdwO-U0miMDlrktAoiz0wZWHJ1V2l7F46CaXTOluyo8Hy36T1h1hEcIQNdHAv1tBhf6MzDGHGZq8ZRI"

2021-06-17 00:46:00,"In case you didn't see it, 45 minutes ago this news item in part came out.With respect to the lobbying efforts, the court ruled, “Ripple’s fair notice defense centres on the activities of the SEC, not its own behaviours. In the same vein, Ripple’s lobbying efforts regarding the status of XRP are nor relevant; and any relevancy argument is outweighed by the burden of production.”This particular ruling managed to garner the attention of several people in the community. Popular attorney James K. Filan, for instance, stated that the aforementioned pronouncement is a “good sign” for Ripple’s fair notice defense. In what was another recent development, the court also granted the SEC additional time to extend its discovery deadlines. Drawing parallels, attorney Jeremy Hogan said,“I am getting a vibe from the Judge that she is digging the Fair Notice Defense… This takes away a little sting from the 60 day extension.”Additionally, attorney John E. Deaton opined that the court is providing a “fair and even hand” with respect to the rulings. He further stressed that the judge highlighting that the fair notice defense centered on the activities of the SEC, and not Ripple’s knowledge or behavior, delivered a “big blow” to the SEC’s case. He added, “In short, the SEC is also on trial.”						View Edits"

2021-06-15 15:41:00,"The 60 day extension is most definitely not the end of the world..... I believe she is being very careful not to totally destroy the SEC moving forward. She has ruled in favour of Ripple 3 times previously and ruled in their favour twice again yesterday.This is exactly what she should be doing. Plus it allows ripple to really get their momentum behind the Email drop box content and ETH/BTC/XRP securities conversations had by the SEC behind closed doors.I know there are so many conspiracy theories surrounding the case. I don't believe its delay tactics by the SEC and JP Morgan/Goldman Sachs to allow swift and or whoever to catch up technologically!!!NO I believe it is the case that there is simply huge corruption within the SEC and that has now been blown wide open without doubt. It is undeniable that Clayton and Hinman have committed some serious trading crimes and have deliberately tried to destroy the most innovative company within the American Fintech space.This was for personal gain and gain for their peers straight up and simple.....Judge Netburn knows this, she reads the news, she reads twitter, she watches and hears everything. But remember this, she also has to protect the SEC to a certain degree that's obvious. What she isn't doing is allowing them to bully her or give them cart blanche in this case. I believe she is most certainly siding with ripple throughout the discovery stage.She knows there's something really rotten in Denmark. She is allowing it to be exposed enough to get summary judgement and settlement and then create regulation for the crypto space. She understands what XRP and ripple are and do she aint stupid.She also knows that maybe brad and Larsen have gained wealth in somewhat of an unorthodox way and most probably against the rules. I am pretty sure they will have to pay a fine and get slapped down a little also for this to be closed out.We all know Gensler has turned out to be a toothless Pitbull. He's no different than his predecessor and is a typical bureaucrat  and a total waste of space. Any ways that is my take on the latest ruling...."
2021-06-15 13:11:00,"As disappointing as it may feel for this 60-day continuation of discovery, I choose to look at it as a type of cheap insurance against a possible appeal by the sec assuming the court finds in favor of Ripple. In other words, the Judge will have shown to have granted them more time IN SPITE of the fact that the SEC has twice been ordered to turn over discovery documentation.  Assuming that the court finds in favor of Ripple (and I pray that is exactly what happens) the SEC will not, in my opinion, be able to effectively articulate a cause for bias or harm by the Judge, or a misapplication of the law. If a 60-day delay means we will not have to live under a cloud of uncertainty vis a vis an appeal, so be it. GO XRP!"

2021-06-12 00:52:00,XRP has been trading in a narrow range. There seems to be some life brewing. Lots of sideline viewers  waiting to see the next SEC moves which look like an Amish Man trying  dance to Mambo Music. Volume has been very low with resistance being  provided at $0.88 as Bitshit is directing the action for all coins. From my tracking for the past 3 1/2 years my indications are if XRP breaks the current resistance level of  $0.88 we could see  $1.02  by the end of this weekend.  Only my  personal opinions!

2021-06-11 17:17:00,"Is XRP really going to break out like everyone is saying, or is it best just to stick with Cardano?To answer this with any certainty you need to check if either XRP or ADA has decoupled from Bitcoin. Because for there to be a break out, or in other words a run up in price to some figure that coin guru’s have picked out of the sky either one of two things needs to happen.Bitcoin (BTC), breaks up from it’s sideways movement since the crash which started on May 19th. If BTC can get a solid break aboove 40K and continue up then pretty much all the major alt coins are going to break out as well. So there is the first possibility for XRP to break up. This will also move ADA up.the second possibility is a decoupling from Bitcoin. For this to occur there needs to be a good reason for folks to think XRP should go up when BTC is staying flat. That might be breaking news that the SEC has dropped the lawsuit. That would decouple XRP from BTC for a few days most likely. Of course as of lately there has not been a whole of news about XRP and it is probably unlikely there will be much of any news besides something about the lawsuit. If Ripple wins or the SEC decides to drop the legal action, then there is the possibility that Elon Musk might tweet something positive about XRP which would also be bullish for the coin and might help XRP decouple from the BTC train.Now lets look at the possibilities for ADA. If you compare the chart of ADA to BTC there seems to already be a bit of decoupling going on. After BTC crashed, ADA was the first asset in the top 20 by Market cap to recover. Cardano has been bullish for quite some time in fact. The only thing that had much of an effect on the ADA chart was the BTC crash which pulled every coin down with it.ADA is about to become smart contract capable when the Alanzo hard fork goes live in August. This will give developers an option to build on the Cardano Ecosystem instead of the Ethereum system. It opens up a lot of possibilities and is almost certainly to give a boost to ADA’s price.ADA is also working toward many other goals like the Africa project which helps poor people validate information like diplomas and GPA records for students, deeds for real estate, and titles for different kinds of assets. This is such a great use for Block Chain technology and I know of no other Crypto project that is doing stuff like this.Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, (ADA) has such a broad vision for the project that it is impossible to mention it all in a short Quora answer.So bottom line in comparing these two coins is there seems to be several reasons for ADA to continue going up and only the possibility of one or two reasons for XRP to go up. So IMHO it might be a good idea to bet on ADA over XRP.But if the lawsuit gets dropped and the financial news media make a big deal of the news, then for at least a short time XRP will probably outperform BTC and ADA.BTW. This is not financial advice. I write these answers because it makes me think more about how I will invest my hard earned money. Please do your own homework and think hard before you invest in any thing and I hope this helps you think about it. Have a great day! Live long and prosper!Jay Thompson."

Involved market manipulation, paid for ""partnerships"", paid for exchange listings, and an extensive market campaign targeting retail investments.Interesting bit: ""339. Much of the onboarding onto ODL was not organic or market-driven. Rather, it was subsidized by Ripple. Though Ripple touts ODL as a cheaper alternative to traditional payment rails, at least one money transmitter (the “Money Transmitter”) found it to be much more expensive and therefore not a product it wished to use without significant compensation from Ripple.340. Between early 2019 and July 2020, the “Money Transmitter” conducted the overwhelming majority of XRP trading volume in connection with ODL. Ripple had to pay the Money Transmitter significant financial compensation—often paid in XRP—in exchange for the Money Transmitter’s agreement to help Ripple increase volume on ODL.341. Specifically, from 2019 through June 2020, Ripple paid the Money Transmitter 200 million XRP, which the Money Transmitter immediately monetized by selling XRP into the public market, typically on the very days it received XRP from Ripple. The Money Transmitter publicly disclosed earning over $52 million in fees and incentives from Ripple through September 2020.""So, it was much more expensive to use Ripple's system than traditional systems, and they had to pay these transmitters large sums to create artificial volume. The whole company is a big marketing campaign.						View Edits"

We have after 3 years of hell now settled at higher lows and a more stable price. Yes XRP is still influenced by BTC's rises and falls but it sustains and rebuilds pretty quick now. Remember it hasn't been like this ever!!!Admittedly certain people who make certain comments do seem to have a direct impact on the entire crypto market and I am pretty sure that cant be disputed. But look at it in real terms and look at the value of the infrastructure, the adoption, the building of a strong foundation in readiness for the next chapter.....Yes the SEC lawsuit sucks, its immoral, its corrupt and it stinks to high heaven of personal gain. I really don't believe Judge Netburn or indeed judge Torres who is ultimately the one Netburn is being advised by will allow the SEC to get away with the amount of silly ness they are attempting.It is easy to let your emotions get the better of you when you have invested money you don't have or indeed you are financially compromised and XRP is your one way ticket out... If that is the case you are going to be disappointed as this will take time to reach the heights you expect. Unless you own more than 100k XRP you are going to be waiting a very long time if ever to be a crytpo millionaire.I believe most retail investors own between 500 and 10K and they buy a couple of hundred at a a time using spare cash they should be using to buy groceries, paying the insurance, feeding the kids etc. I think maybe that's why their emotions run so high.I haven't bought any dips since 2019 early 2020, why? because I invested enough to drop my average to a level my holdings have a real world opportunity to make me a millionaire. I could have bought thousands more xrp at .17 for months but I didn't because I had invested all I am prepared to lose. That's the point guys, its all very well buying these dips at ever increasing higher lows, but all that does is increase your exposure and increase your anxiety. Unless you have spare cash, a lot of spare time and can sit and play the market just as Veyor does, then don't do it. Veyor has lived his life and has the requisite time and funds to do just that, if his comments are ""getting old"" and his ""Mantra"" upsets you, don't read his posts. To be fair he has been consistent.Sometimes its better to be happy and accept what you have and sit back and enjoy the ride...."

2021-06-03 11:12:00,"SAMUEL WAN · JUNE 3, 2021 AT 2:00 AM UTCRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse called the [SEC] action an attack on the whole cryptocurrency industry.He also said he, along with Ripple chairman Chris Larsen, were given the option to settle. But given his strength of conviction, he turned this down to prove his case and pave the way for the rest of the crypto industry.“Chris and I had the option to settle separately. We could do that, and it would all be behind us. NOT happening. That’s how confident Chris and I are that we are right. We will aggressively fight – and prove our case – through this case we will get clear rules of the road for the industry here in the U.S,” said Garlinghouse at the time.Throughout this process, oddities on the part of the SEC have emerged, including disregard of XRP investors, failure to act sooner, and possible conflicts of interest from former SEC leaders.Meanwhile, tech writer Roslyn Layton points out that a “Ripple test” is needed as payback for the SEC’s “bad behavior” and overreach in bringing this case:“Some investors want to punish the SEC for its bad behavior and reduce the temptation for it to abuse its authority in the future. In any event, the SEC needs its own “Ripple Test” to restore its credibility.”Read full article: https://cryptoslate.com/odds-are-the-sec-will-opt-to-settle-ripple-lawsuit-before-reaching-trial/"

2021-05-24 16:23:00,This correction was really brutal for XRP. It's nice to see 0.8x again. The perspective of a potential bear market that could last for another three-four years + lack of clarity on the SEC/Ripple case caused a massive selling pressure. Also last week judge denied Ripple’s bid to bar SEC from seeking foreign info on XRP. Link to article here: https://forkast.news/ripple-sec-xrp-ruling-foreign-info/ . I this this was the nail in the coffin that caused the massive sell off. Obviously the overall market conditions didn't help.  However the second half of 2021 may be in favor for XRP as we will be getting closer to the end of the SEC/Ripple case. The case is important for Ripple and XRP but I think it will also impact the entire cryptosphere. The result could be negative. There is no easy money in this world. However I think the current bull run for crypto is not over yet and it will last until the end of the year. The most interesting part for XRP is still about to happen. I am overinvested in XRP and sometimes I can't handle it. Sorry for my stupid posts from the past. Best of luck to all XRP holders!

Not sure why would big money flow into the crypto universe (or the stock market) if the government wants to take almost 50 % of the profit.4) China banning crypto related transactions5) China clamping down on miners6) XRP holders constantly thrashing BTC on the XRP forum, not knowing that the entire foundation of the crypto universe is dependent on BTC. (Haha ! just kidding on this one)I wish BTC makes an U-turn and goes back to 50K again."

2021-05-22 08:41:00,"After listening to the court case I just have to vent. The whole case is a joke. The SEC lawyer stated the SEC was confused as what to do about Ripple. On that note the case should have ended right then and there. They were confused for 7 years. I feel very uncomfortable with judges. Even though she seems to be siding with RIpple's attorneys most of the time.  Questions:1- Was trading halted when Bitshit  was in negation with the SEC? I don't think so.2-Bitshit performs no function other than scamming people out of their money . When a hand full of billionaires & Whales drive it up then smack it down. Only they make money with Bitchit.3- How much money did the SEC guys divide when they cleared Bitshit and ETH.  as currencies? I feel like I am watching a heavy weight championship boxing match. The Ref scores the fight 12 rounds to 0 in favor of The Ripper. The two judges are from the defending champs home town  vote 10 rounds to 2 in favor of the SEC. The Ripper gets  screwed. My advise to The Rippers lawyers is, NO SETTLEMENTS, TAKE IT TO THE WALL. Send  the SEC'S. two settlement lawyers back to Chicago."

How about attorneys that said go for it? All that time the SEC and Clayton sat with their thumb up their asses. Disgraceful. Congress too. Oh they'll pipe in now over their own interest. What a few attorney opinions either way shouldn't be discoverable. 7 damn yrs of SEC scilence.You sure can tell when crooked government bureaucrats want to destroy something. Even if it's good.

2021-05-21 04:47:00,"Brian Brooks (U.S. Gov Acting Comptroller of the Currency from May 29, 2020 to January 14, 2021): Excerpt from Bloomberg interview, 2020.05.19...The token-focused approach is the WRONG approach.Instead, think about the networks for which the tokens exist.  That's what ALL tokens are about -- i.e. to induce people/businesses, etc. into using the networks.It does not mater which token will be more valuable than another token tomorrow, but whether you have a thesis for the underlying ""thing"" that they are powering.For example, you do not buy Apple stock because you think the stock is going up or down. No. You buy Apple stock because you think i-phones will win in the market. So by definition, your stock is going to go up in the market. With tokens, it is no different.So, for example, if you think  ETH is the best platform to build financial services & apps, then ETH tokens are going to go up in value.Stop thinking about the technical analysis of the shape of the price movements, and start focusing on the NETWORK that is being built! The NETWORKS that win will have VERY VALUABLE tokens. That's why at the OCC we really focus on the NETWORKS that the tokens power -- NOT the token.Some of these networks are being used to transfer VALUE from person A to person B, so they should be regulated like Swift and the automated clearing house, right? It is very easy to understand that!"

2021-05-19 19:27:00,In periods like this it is very scary. When it is up you dream for dips to buy. When it actually dips you start to think may be that is a start of a bear market? It is not totally impossible that we are witnessing the starting of a bear market at the moment. Whales will always fuck 99.9% of us.I am happy I fixed my profits couple of day ago and sold 50% thus making + for all my spendings in past 4 years. I will now wait for a good point to reenter. Good luck to all!

First he bought BTC to pump the market to show it can be hyped and manipulated by 1 person. Second he said Tesla won’t accept btc for his useless cars citing environmental issues  which means btc cannot be a payment system . Third he asked a question how btc is decentralised if one person can manipulate the value with a tweet and that China has more number of miners and controls btc. Finally when Btc is about to go below the money Tesla invested, he will dump btc saying it cannot be considered as an asset or store of value. He also proved a shit coin with no utility can be hyped and pumped. Finally he might create his own crypto or endorse a cryto which was created by a huge company like xrp"

2021-05-14 00:06:00,Did you know about Monty Hall paradox? Say there are 3 doors in front of you. There is nothing behind 2 of them and money behind 1 door. You choose any door. Then any of the 2 remaining doors is opened. Say there is nothing behind opened door. Now you are asked if you want to change choosen door with the remaining unopened. And the paradox is if you change chances you find the money is 2/3 compared to 1/3 if you don't change! This is really strange because you think there is jo sense to change cause chance are 50/50.Well what this have to do with crypto and xrp? I have no idea. Just saw it and thought it would be interesting :) Change money to XRP tokens if you wish...

In my opinion,  in the early going the SEC was getting beat up almost on a daily basis. That would have been the time for the SEC to bring in their two top guns from Chicago. The two top guns happen to be their experts, who in the past have been involved in making deals settling cases. If they are going to make a deal it would be to save face, Lawyers opinions I have been reading claim all indicate are that the SEC can't  win the case. By drawing up a settlement to look like they did not lose, they probably will give Ripple a slap on the wrist fine for past actions and clear them for what they are doling currently. Even though Ripple should win the case, the SEC could drag the case on, which would not be beneficial for Ripple. It would be beneficial for Ripple to settle as quick as possible. In my opinion the case could be settled within the next 3 weeks. Again this is only my opinion."

2021-05-09 19:12:00,"Reading all the latest comments on this forum lately makes me realise how much disbelief is still around when it comes to XRP. It's all doom and gloom and XRP won't get anywhere anymore, not even to it's ATH because other coins have moved past the price of it. There's no end in sight and we should all probably sell our XRP holdings and buy Doge and other similar coins that don't have much use but only hype. Hype and speculating the moment can get you quick and big returns indeed but that's only possible during this stage of the market. I honestly thought that this cycle will be different and more versed investors will be joining the party but it seems that I was wrong. Patience in this market is key as Warren Buffet summarised this very well too by saying: ""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.” Good luck and make sure you're paying close attention to the fundamentals too. ;-)"

2021-05-08 23:58:00,"It’s being suggested by some that if Elon promotes the meme coin on SNL he may get himself in hot water with the SEC and possibly other regulators.A sense from the current climate seems to indicate that the SEC is looking for reasons to justify getting heavenly involved in regulating crypto in general -- which some analysts say is on the horizon, anyway. Elon could very well end up being that catalyst for facilitating such if he even remotely mentions (pumps) the coin on SNL.In any case, the coin may now be setup for an unavoidable crash no matter what happens. If he does not mention the coin on SNL (to the dismay and disappointment of many viewers), the FOMO hysteria bubble may quickly deflate and result in a crash. If he mentions the coin, he may get in hot water with the SEC and other regulators, causing panic, thus bursting the bubble and crashing the coin. This might be a lose-lose scenario for the coin. Either way, up, down, left or right, next week should be somewhat entertaining.What might any of this do to/for XRP? Who knows? As usual with this or any other speculation, it’s anybody’s guess."

2021-05-06 04:26:00,Everything's pumping. No matter what the purpose of the coin is. Dogecoin is a perfect example. Randomness. PPL are happy to put all their saving into a coin for one reason only. The reason is that two weeks ago it was worth 70% less than now. They expect that in two weeks the price will rise again. Madness. The entire crypto market is not even worth $1. I don't know when exactly this bull market will end. One thing for sure. Shorting shitcoins will be a very good opportunity at some point. Without the SEC case I would most likely be out of XRP at this stage waiting to open short positions. I expected the bull market to last until December. However this time (comparing to 2017) there are more shitcoins out there and if you take into consideration the total market cap for all of them it makes me wonder how much longer this circus can last for. Housewives have already invested. Who is buying now?

2021-05-01 03:26:00,"I have listened to the entire hearing and the SEC is again on the back foot. Initially I thought the judge had her mind set and this will go in favour of the SEC but to be honest, by the time Ripple have finished their response the SEC has been caught lying, again! It really boggles the mind on how their lawyers do that and why but I guess the fact that they have the Federal and State power behind them, somehow that give them the right. All the SEC points on why the MOU's are a valid discovery method for them and that they should be used in court have been dismantled in my view by the Ripple lawyers. The Judge deferred to make a ruling at the end of it and said she'd like to have more advice on the matter (probably to check the decision with Judge Torres) and soon enough a written order will be issued with the decision.I will not be surprised to hear something by the end of today but most likely it will be early next week.

The SEC is about to be exposed to the shady accusations they have made against Ripple XRP.  We all know it and so does congress.  They aRE waisting the courts time with this BS lawsuit.  Ginsler knows it and he is looking for a way out without losing face.  Something big is about to surface and the price action reflects it.  stay tuned my friends and keep HODLING.  $$$$ we are going to be in control very soon.

We are currently at 130B usd with a price of 1,3 usd per XRP and in comparison to ETH for example which is 287B at 2482 usd per ETH. To get to 5 usd per XRP the market cap would almost have to be double of what ETH currently is or half of what BTC is.

However once I woke up this morning the price was higher than at the time when I was opening the bottle. The lesson is: chill out, don't watch the market all the time and hold your XRP.

In order to move price of BTC up we need to buy it right? Ok I decided to invest 100M$ in BTC. I am buying it and its price goes up.

2021-04-25 19:02:00,XRP / BTC -7% in the last 24 hours. We lost against all coins and lost our momentum from two weeks ago. The market dragged us down. I don't want to create conspiracy theories but my feeling is that whales do this on purpose. I am not an expert but whenever XRP starts to pump the entire market starts a correction and drags us down and we stay at the low level for some time while everything else returns to the levels from before the correction.

In the past 24 hours, major crypto exchanges have shifted as much as 177.6 million Ripple (XRP).  These transactions, which amount to about $ 2,227 million, seem to be taking the coins outside America.  This in the run-up to the handling of new allegations added by the SEC in the ongoing lawsuit.  Large stock exchanges therefore take precautions to prevent any seizure or freezing of trade in America.  As we see in the live prices, this does not (yet) lead to negative sentiment among investors"

2021-04-19 21:40:00,"The SEC has been shooting themselves in the foot since the trial started. The new head of the SEC knows he inherited  a bad situation. In order for him to save the face of the SEC, they should sit down with the Ripple people and talk to them.  10  years ago Ripple was a security. Ripple has always been trying to get clarity  from the SEC however none was ever provided. This will show there was no fraud intended by Brad. Ripple will get a slap on the wrist with some fines  then the case will be dropped.  I don't think the SEC wants this to go to a judges decision?At this time the SEC should  work with the Crypto community and set up guide lines.. In addition the SEC is not protection the investors who are in the process of  taking actions against the SEC who are supposed to be their  protection, Millions of dollars have been lost by investors due to  sanctions placed on investors in the US.

2021-04-19 21:26:00,"Ok boys and girls I am going to throw my Tuppence worth into the pot!!!SEC V Ripple1) Absolute disgrace and a farce in every way. 2) Total conflict of interest everywhere with Jay Clayton and Hinman.3) Total corruption from above said 2 vile human beings.4) A total lack of care for investors and the hard earned monies put in and lost due to the case being filed. 5) Proven factual evidence that again, above said men are now working for interested parties in ETH and BTC. (screams corruption and fraud).6) completely underhand and slimy way in which Jay Clayton filed the suit as he ran away from the SEC.7) SEC's pants pulled down over denial to financial records of BG and CL.8) SEC's Pants pulled down over having to give access to all internal communications regarding XRP, BTC and ETH.9) SEC about to have their pants pulled down and have their shitty dirty fat arse spanked for breaking federal court laws by intimidating foreign business associates etc.10) Its proven beyond all doubt that XRP is undeniably not a security and is a digital currency.11) Proven XRP is and has such massive utility and use cases and is being partnered by massive FI's.12) XRP LOSES CASE DUE TO THE ABSOLUTE CORRUPTION WITHIN THE US LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE CORRUPTION WITHIN THE HOUSE OF POWER.Lets face it everyone. There are so many high profile, public, glaring open and shut cases that we all see and hear about throughout every news channels and social media platform that happen everyday within this cesspool of American justice.Don't get to comfortable with the thought Ripple will walk away from this.... I am not convinced!!!Before my American friends lambast me for being anti USA.... You all know that is not the case, I am speaking the truth and you guys know it!!! Don't get me wrong it would be the same in the UK, however, Uk does seem to be less corrupt and the general public don't stand for that kinda nonsense. Because we don't have so many layers of governance its easier for corruption to be dealt with and exposed which tends to whip up a storm and as we brits are very stiff upper lip it usually ends with a resignation and some sort of policy change.I love the United States and the people are generally bloody good folks and are always welcoming and friendly, your country is vast and very beautiful throughout, You have given the world so much..... But FFS your legal system and your government is so disgustingly corrupt and so so confusing to everyone.I cant get excited about any news from this case until I see it in Black and white or whatever gender or colour you want (don't want to be accused of racism or bigotry).I need to see the SEC case fall apart and XRP to be legally defined by the SEC as a digital Currency, Ripple founders exonerated, Jay Clayton and Hinman to be investigated and indicted and taken to trial for corruption. I could go on but I think you get my point!!"

Its an opinion (you don't have to agree) its me trying to be 2 steps ahead psychologically and never forgetting XRP likes to fuck you.So yes there it was the correction most knew was coming. The holders didn't sell, the traders sold the dip but then it dropped. We all got a bit screwed, some were completely screwed. Now we have a dead cat that isn't bouncing. My thoughts are (and this is not advice)1) we double bottom2) we stay around this value for a fair while, adding to everyone annoyance who are left holding heavy expensive bags3) we then remind ourselves ""must remember to sell the top"" so that its etched in the forefront of our brains4) price suddenly jumps, back to 1.80, 1.90 (you're thinking this time Im gonna sell half. 5)Price goes above last high, you sell some more thinking, well I've regained my losses from last time. 6) we are now heading towards a new ATH (you think why did I sell so cheap?) 7) we pass old ATH but youve already sold 80% of your bag8) you think shiiitttt I've waited 3 years and missed the boat. Il just buy some in the dip, the dip doesn't come here but its 4 times the price I last paid so fuck it im just gonna buy some anyway9) you buy, it dumps, you sell at a loss. 10) XRP goes to the stratosphere $10 per XRP and you're left with nearly empty bag.There is of course the other anology, where the hodler (who has done relatively well so far) doesn't sell the top and carries an extremely heavy and profitable bag from hero to zero, just like they did last night.

You've recently made friends with XRP but you've also forgotten this bitchcunt will fuck you at every opportunity, and she's already planning her next move.Just think about the psychology. Market pumps a bit now and we get over $2. Now you say to yourself, well we must be going for the ATH because all the other coins did it.... it rises further 2.50 2.60 2.70 everyone is longing XRP thinking they're the wolf of wall Street, then BANG!!!. XRP down to 1 dollar again. From nowhere and because BTC made a tiny dip.Fact is XRP is the MOST manipulated and over played coin on the market. You could have held any other top 10 crypto for the last 12 months and already made 20× with relative ease, yet here we are at 8× with XRP, with yet another major court case hanging over us, regulation of crypto on the horizon and delisting across the US.  ALL THIS yet Judging by most people posting, they really believe their golden goose has come home to roost. Let me tell you, XRP is not here to make you money. It is here to fuck you. Dont be naive. When there is profit, take it! Dont think its going to be easy, and if you choose to never sell, you better have balls of steel and a bank account of gold. This coin is out to fuck you and always has been. There will be an ATH but it wont happen when you want it to happen. Take caution.One last thing. If you have good profit. Think about diversifying.  De-fi and gaming are the hottest atm. If bitcoin suddenly drops 40% you can bet your ass XRP will drop 80%. If you're diversified the liklihood is that you won't sink like a rock. I wish I was diversified in December. My profit has all gone into other coins now. And some to my own pocket too.						View Edits"

However, he classified it as “nonsense” that “needs to be put to death for good.”“So, if you bought $1,000 worth of crypto and its price dropped to $500, you went from no better and no worse off than someone with $1,000 to no better and no worse off than someone with $500. To say that that’s not losing money is completely absurd.” – he concluded.Following a comment about the importance of profit taking with any investment tools, Schwartz replied with his bitcoin approach. Ripple’s executive said he had been gradually disposing of his BTC holdings starting at $100. He continued selling off at other round-numbered milestones, such as $750, $2,500, $7,500, $20,000, and lastly – $50,000.Ultimately, he indicated that he’s left with only 2% of his bitcoin position. Nevertheless, it seems that Schwartz may have some regrets about selling at the aforementioned prices, replying “that’s the downside of de-risking” to a comment saying “imagine if you would have held on to the 98% till date.”"

2021-04-16 05:11:00,"I just read an article  where the writer was praising Mr Schwarts, a Ripple CEO  for his strategy of selling off all of his BTC investment piece at a time at different intervals from $100 to $700 to $2,500 , 7500 etc leaving him with a 2 % of his stack remaining today. No wonder Ripple is always getting into trouble with guys like him at the helm. How much would he have been  worth if he either held all his holdings or even sold half for profit and held at least  50% ?  How much would he have made on his investment? A good lesson for Rippers holding on until the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. I rest my case. You be the JUDGE!"

2021-04-16 01:22:00,https://www.tradingview.com/i/UeQa07t2/I just want to highlight my view on XRPUSD (Ripple)! (Not a setup)We had a lot of fundamental price manipulation over the past two months including thecurrent S.E.C Lawsuit and other news.Many private investors got shaken out and panic-sold their XRP Holdings.I am a Technical Trader but Fundamentals align perfectly right now andeverything looks like we at least repeat 2017 bull run...We had a closure above 61.8 Fib for the first time repeatingthe same pattern with an insane price action.let us know what you think in the comment section..Alanhttps://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/

2021-04-15 21:13:00,"You know its solid advice from XRP CTO that you should sell when you are up. Because for ripple, if 620m in long positions are sold (mind you, some bought just before the rally of '17 and remember the ATH at $4) others will buy. Now this reflects a loss of 8-10%. If the horde had hodl'ed to expected $5 EOY, the overall stability of the HOLD would be shit. People expecting $5 when bought at 0.46 are a lot less careful than people who bought at 1.60. They would want to see $5 for sure, creating more stability for the centralized Ripple platform. Qui Bono people. Ripple Bono."

2021-04-14 22:26:00,XRP hit $1.96 in the very early morning. The idiots are now taking profits                                                            when the SEC is installing a new director of the Sec who is pro Crypto. When he is installed by Congress at 10:30 the price during the day should rise by 20 cents.  If they wanted to take profits that would have been the time. Under these conditions there would have been less profit taking because the settlement of the Law suit will be just around the corner. The Sins of the world was and always will be GREED.

The Ripper has hit $1.49 this a week alone on the good things going our way so far in the court with the SEC. There is no doubt The Ripper will win the case, if not a settlement will be made so the SEC can keep face. At that time we could see the Ripper in the $3-$5 range. You sell out for chump change. Hedge Funds start buying it up along with big time investors, banks and money transfer companies all over the world start using XRP, Within the next year or two.  All those Moon guys taking the chump change and start spending it on foolish things like those dummies who won the lottery for millions and millions of dollars end up broke in a short time.  Play the waiting game and re- invest your  winnings  then live of the fat of the land with money still working for you. Lambo and Mooners are just immature  losers."

2021-04-11 23:20:00,"Congratulations to all the holders and strong hands who instead of panicking and selling they actually bought more on the dips. Taking some profits along the way is always a good plan and ensure you do have an exit plan and execute it as planned. At this point XRP should consolidate and potentially even retrace around $1.00 for a few weeks. We may hear though more good news from the SEC vs Ripple hearings and I would not be surprised to see a settlement coming up soon once Gensler will be named. We may also hear about more US exchanges resuming trading of XRP, including Coinbase who is about to IPO next week. I will look on getting some of their shares too if available on the platforms where I am active but I would not go all in as usually after the initial listing  price will have a correction too. The bull market for XRP is currently just warming up and personally I would expect prices to reach ATH within a few months and then surpass it. Good luck and make sure you capitalise on these moves and secure profits."

The same was with the Coinbase listing back in 2018. Expectations matter for the price not the facts. But I am wrong in 99% cases so please ignore this post. 😁

Back in 2018 when price rose to $3.92, it crashed down to near zero in no time, all due to XRP owners had majority control and walked away with billions in profits.  They could keep introducing more coins into the market effecting the price. The ownership should be spread out to minimize this. Just a thought."

2021-04-04 06:14:00,How can the SEC advise that XRP is a security.  when a security is traded it takes trade date.. plus 3 days to settle. XRP transacts cross border payments and settles in seconds.  That alone constitutes a digital currency.  so what is this witch hunt all about.  The SEC is wasting the courts time and clogging up the real issues that the govt should be going after. This is a utility and a digital currency ...any moron can see for themselves.  They are looking for a corrupt / blackmail payday and settlement that BG and Chris L. should not succumb to.  Let this play out because XRP/Ripple should not pay the sec (one dime).  I really think the judge sees this black and white. Just MHO.

2021-04-03 03:58:00,"The Problem of LiquidityRipple’s stated goal of this incentive program is to lower what it calls ‘liquidity cost.’ “Since we’re offering the incentives in XRP, we anticipate seeing an added benefit of building an easy on-ramp for institutions to use XRP in their payment flows to lower liquidity cost in the future,” “Early reception of these XRP incentives in a test phase has been very positive.”The question of liquidity cost, in fact, is at the heart of Ripple’s international payments product strategy. For XRP to work as an intermediate currency, banks or other institutions must maintain sufficient reserves of XRP in order to respond to requests for transactions.However, there are two massive problems with this approach. First, XRP is simply too volatile. “You need someone to provide the liquidity to be able to change into and out of Ripple,” explains Martin Walker, director for banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management. “And holding Ripple, a currency which has seen its price drop 80 percent and then back up 100 percent in the course of the last two months is just not credible.”Second, maintaining liquidity in XRP doesn’t solve the core problem with money transfers from countries with more stable currencies to those with less stable ones, as such transfers generally go only one way. For example, for a financial services firm to handle payments from the US to Guatemala, it would need to have liquidity in Guatemalan Quetzals in order to disburse payments. Liquidity in XRP would be useless. is this true?"

A conflict of interest.  2018 Ripple donated 50 mill to MIT towards blockchain inovation and Ginsler was the professor teaching blockchain at the time and the university accepted the donation.  so know he is going to rule against something his peers accepted and used funds.

In my way of thinking this is all on him and the SEC have been left with egg all over their face.I really cant see how the Judge at some point isn't going to just stand up and call a halt to this farcical lawsuit and declare XRP a NON security and maybe even open the doors to investors being able to sue the SEC.What a frickin joke....."

I am starting to feel that it is rather blown out of proportion for sure, the figures don't really match up against other flu's etc. and the travel restrictions could possibly be a way to stem migration and to control movement, who the hell knows for sure...I am totally fed up with the knock on effect it has on basic life and business. It is disruptive and costly and has impacted our company and our revenue greatly. I have lost over GBP 30k of my basic salary as a voluntary cut to ensure I kept my job and my lifestyle.

BOOM.... My world literally fell apart. Was on the second hole at the golf course and Started struggling to catch my breath and lost all energy. Even though it was 43 degrees I was sweating cold and shivering. My nose just seemed to let go and was streaming, then came the worst dizziness I have ever experienced, like being seriously drunk and you see double and the world is spinning.I managed to get to hole 6 before the extreme stomach cramps began, by hole 9 I was running off the green to get to the men's room. Had to go home in an Uber and leave the car at the club as I couldn't drive I felt so shit.  Laid on the settee under the AC vents and after 5 or so hours all the symptoms just disappeared. Just a bit of advice, be prepared for it when you have your second dose, nearly 80% of the people here that have had the second jab have experienced some if not all the symptoms described above.

2021-03-10 14:26:00,"Petr KulhanekJune 24, 2019Is XRP (Ripple) ever going to explode in the next 3 years?We can say many times that XRP is the best crypto for payments, but we know what defines the price, market.How to get higher price? Usecases, adoption, usage, need, of XRP. Why it is still 0.4 ? Because all partnerships and usage promos, are done on paper and not on XRPL. Once it is real, I mean billions of USD are sent via XRPL, the price of XRP has to mirror that.Which means, if daily real volume is $100 bio, XRP will be $10 and you can continue. $5 trio is daily volume for swift, if XRPL takes 10% of it, it determines XRP price to $50. Why? You simply cannot send such an amount of value with low XRP price because you would need too many coins which are not available for transaction, therefore price will go up.If XRP is liquidity pool for all ALTs, ILP, Libra coin, Swift, Coil, FED, IMF, … the price might stabilize at $200 - $300.Let’s see."

XRP wont disappear and if people realize that their money is losing value we will see a huge run on all assets, also cryptocurrencies. Then you win, no matter which cryptocurrencies you hold (almost) because it’s all about Bitcoin and Altcoins always follow the King. I think the US fiat dollar will lose credibility because he’s the leader of all fiat currencies just like BTC for Alts. Maybe I’m wrong but that’s what i feel if I put all informations together.Exciting times and I wonder how long this broken system can survive. Maybe 5-10 years ? Made some good profit with other coins and cashed out and got back in with a good amountAfter we crashed with this SEC case and im feeling good with ripple because there is a huge shit storm about this coin. Just my opinion and no advice to invest in XRP because it’s a high risk and volatile investment.Good luck :)"

2021-03-03 06:17:00,I heard Gary Gentler was sworn in today with his right hand on the XRPL Whitepapers.
2021-03-03 04:57:00,"My 2 cents after all of this time:I believe there will eventually be a settlement, but it will be unique.  How does a settlement occur that involves the SEC saying what you did is illegal so we're fining you, but we're going to allow it to continue?  I don't think the SEC wants to allow a precedent of 100% pre-mined tokens being used to enrich the founders and fund operations for years and years.  I also don't think they want to kill Ripple and their groundbreaking tech.  So what do they do?  They say Xrp was a security, but recognize the efforts of Ripple to decentralize and say it is now a currency.  I believe there will be heavy fines, Ripple will be allowed to continue as they are and Xrp will prove in the end to be a solid investment.  That being said, I do encourage everyone to stay diligent and to avoid falling into the extremes of falling in love with or hating the guts of any investment.  Listen to all sides of any story and use your brain more than your heart when investing.  This message was brought to you by a pot of delicious coffee."

2021-03-02 18:52:00,"OK peeps. Make of this what you will of the below explanation of the Howey test. I think we can all determine our own thoughts and beliefs within the text of this article. I think the fact ""Ripple"" the company didn't sell XRP to private retail investors directly, shows that a investment contract for speculative  profits hasn't actually taken place.Retail investors bought via exchanges for their own personal gain, so if that's the case then surely that constitutes having to declare your holdings to the SEC, or did I misunderstand that part?If I didn't then surely all exchanges selling all crypto currencies are actually selling and investment product for speculative profits and gain.....Seeing as the profits come from validators or miners whether or not they are known, or in XRP case pre mined by Ripple then we are profiting from someone else work, therefore we have ALL entered into an investment contract of sorts. So doesn't that mean that all crypto assets should be classed as securities not just XRP????And shouldn't all exchanges and the likes of ETH and Stellar be on trial alongside Ripple??What Is the Howey Test?The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 dictate much of the U.S. government's approach to financial regulation, even nearly 100 years after they were established. Under these acts, transactions which qualify as ""investment contracts"" are considered securities, meaning that they are also subject to specific requirements related to disclosure and registration.Predictably, this has a significant impact on how the financial world views and interacts with those securities, so it is necessary to have a consistent and thorough way of determining whether a transaction is, in fact, an example of an ""investment contract."" The Howey Test is the standard methodology, put in place by the U.S. Supreme Court, to make that determination.Howey Test ExplainedPut simply, the Howey Test asks whether the value of a transaction for one of its participants is dependent upon the other's work. Specifically, the Howey Test determines that a transaction represents an investment contract if ""a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party,"" The Howey Test refers to a 1946 case which reached the Supreme Court, SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., a lawsuit involving the Howey Company of Florida. This company was a citrus farm which operated on a large swath of land in the southern portion of the state.When the company decided to lease out half of its large property in order to ""finance an additional development,"" the question of whether or not the land itself could be seen as a security came into play. Purchasers of the Howey land, who themselves had none of the ""knowledge, skill, and equipment necessary for the care and cultivation of citrus trees,"" were speculators. They purchased the land based on the assumption that it would generate a profit for them as a result of the efforts of someone else.Howey Co. ran afoul of the law when it failed to register the transactions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) responded with an injunction to block the sale of the land, and the case was eventually appealed, finally arriving in the U.S Supreme Court.The opinion of the Court in the Howey case indicated that ""the transactions in this case clearly involve investment contracts, as so defined. The respondent companies are offering something more than fee simple interests in land...they are offering an opportunity to contribute money and to share in the profits of a large citrus fruit enterprise.""In the case of Howey Co., the investors in the Florida land saw the transaction as valuable only because of the work that others would perform on the land. By the standards of the Howey Test, this classifies the transaction as an investment contract. Thus, the transaction needed to be registered, and the Howey Co. was found to have violated the law by failing to do that.Howey Test Being Applied to Crypto MarketThe Howey Test has remained a notable determiner of regulatory oversight for many decades. In the past few years, it has been called into question, most frequently in conjunction with discussions about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.As investor activity in the cryptocurrency space has grown, the SEC has become increasingly interested in defining cryptocurrencies.Digital currencies like bitcoin are notoriously difficult to categorize in this way; they are decentralized and designed to evade regulation in many ways. Nonetheless, investors who have moved quickly to buy up the latest digital currency in the hopes of turning a profit are undoubtedly engaging in behavior that could be characterized as speculation.From the perspective of the Howey Test, the operative question, in this case, is whether or not cryptocurrency investors are participating in a speculative enterprise, and if so, if the profits those investors are hoping for are entirely dependent upon the work of a third party.If the SEC determines that a particular cryptocurrency token is classified as a security, that brings about a host of implications for that cryptocurrency. Effectively, it means the SEC can determine whether or not the token can be sold to U.S. investors legally or not; it also compels U.S. investors to register their token holdings with the SEC.There are parallels between the cryptocurrency world and the original Howey Co. situation, but there are also many differences. Critically, cryptocurrencies are autonomous and distributed networks that are designed to be decentralized. Classifying a cryptocurrency as a security likely goes sharply against the goals of the creators of that digital currency.However, considering how significant the cryptocurrency space has become, the SEC has a growing interest in monitoring and overseeing cryptocurrency transactions in a way that it sees as appropriate. Regardless of the ultimate regulatory decision, it is sure to have a significant impact on the virtual currency world and investors in that space.						View Edits"
2021-03-02 16:03:00,"WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT FROM A CRYPTO MARKET WITH GARY GENSLER HEAD OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION?MARCH 1, 2021ABAccording to weekly reports, Joe Biden chose Gary Gensler as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He used to be an annex-chairman of the Commodity Future Trading Commission, and now the newly appeared candidate is expected to change the cryptocurrency market once and forever. His inevitable benefit is a constant and devoted work in related areas where, by the way, he reached desired goals and even more. The opinions regarding his candidature are arguing, but the fact is the fact^ he is an experienced professional in this sector and he will definitely know what to do with that in order to develop the industry. For the field of digital assets, this is considered to be great news. Gary Gensler is respected in the community that deals with digital assets. Besides, he has received praise for his work within market structures and swaps. Furthermore, he is known to be an intelligent, and thoughtful personality who cares enough about the rise of crypto-assets and cryptocurrencies to realize and understand the complex part that demonstrates the role of the authorities in triggering innovative approaches to this field. One thing is for certain, Gensler is much more than just a cheerleader for the cause.What should we expect from the authority of the new candidate Gary Gensler?A clear understandingGensler clearly and profoundly realizes the market, its particular value, and the existing development of cryptocurrencies. He spent so much time of his work in order to comprehend the field from different angles. Definitely, his proficiency, talent, and correct approach cannot be doubted that’s why Gensler will occupy this position with a high level of understanding of the field.Market structureThe world expects that Gary Gensler will prioritize a market structure. He differs from his predecessors because he has a strong M&A background in useful for this field areas.The clarity in market structureA powerful concentration on investor protection is expected from Gesler in order to reach the desired balance as a result of such promotion of capital formation via crypto-assets. We expect a concentration on clarity regarding crypto and market structures as this will help trigger more trust and confidence among the investors.ETFs safetyWe expect Gary Gensler will review data on the underlying liquidity of the spot market and the integrity of the specific source marketplaces where the discovery and the establishment of a particular price appear. In what way can these findings be integrated with the investors of the USA safely? Gensler can use Financial Technology not only with the aim to engage purposes but also as a means to drive higher performance and progress in policy through the internal silos.Productive global cooperationWhat about the impact on the global market? A powerful global interaction will be a priority for Gary Gensler during his authority. Remember, the crypto market regulation differs considerably from the global swaps market.In 2021, the international landscape of management in the crypto market differs considerably from 2011. Despite this, there were enough jurisdictions that have begun attempting particularly new regulatory methods in the crypto-assets field."

Just imagine once we have the SEC's blessing the exchanges will have to shut down becuz the action and volume will blow up the exchanges platforms they will not be able to keep up with the buying volume.  So when this does happen the HODLERS will have to sit back and wait for the market to calm down so you can have an orderly pricing.  We are going to witness buying hysteria that we have never seen before.  Day traders are going to get burnt, exchanges will be down for periods of time and we will have to wait for the dust to settle. just prepare and be ready for it. just my educated opinion."

If there were only weak pumps in less than 5 minutes. in the past the way XRP is distributed has been made clear in the SEC report. The future of XRP is still unclear in the legal battle, next time they need a lot of money to pay for the services and lobbying related to the lawsuit. Jed is constantly dumping. Look at the market of XRP in the past session, it rises and falls that are not purely about healthy growth. Those who adopt the intention to share x2, x3 in 1 day forget it. XRP might cost $ 1 but not right now. Just personal speculation."

2021-02-22 05:43:00,"Hope everyone is doing well. Here are my thoughts about what is coming for XRP and where XRP will be by the end of 2021.A lot of people have lost faith in XRP due to the SEC actions who sat quiet for 8 years and did nothing to give any sort of guidance and indication on how these assets should be regulated. You all need to remember that this lawsuit is not intended against XRP but Ripple and the two Execs.XRP is being called many names in the last complaint letter from the SEC but if you looks carefully on what the Prayer for Relief requests are, you will not find anything to state that XRP is deemed a security. However, in the response that Ripple had put forward they are raising the stakes and asking to have that status clarified once in for all. To me this not only shows the confidence that Ripple has in winning this lawsuit but also the determination to fight the old and antique rules of the SEC who only decided to enforce and not to adapt. The main argument in the complaint is that Ripple has sold XRP to fund the development of the XRPL and their operations. Can anyone please let me know how is the ETH Dev army being paid for? Does anyone know how much ETH can be issued or what is the total supply? The ETH blockchain is inflationary in nature and no one can tell you how much of it can be issued as there is on cap. With other projects that do have a total supply the same argument on how the core developers are being paid and incentivised to write code and improve the network security and functionality happens the same way. So you see, if the SEC were to punish Ripple, there is a risk that a lot if not the majority of the alts can also be deemed as a securities in the US.   That means that all crypto projects that currently reside in the US will have to move abroad and operate from other jurisdictions. That is also an option for Ripple as many countries like the UK, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland and many others which will welcome such companies with open arms and encourage innovation and development. The US as a country will be losing a lot and offer a huge advantage to those countries who are and in that scenario to China too, which is a very close to launch their eYuan. And to be clear, Ripple and XRP do represent the real threat for SWIFT who had to develop their touted GPI product that doesn’t address the liquidity problem of that 50 year old system. This is the main reason why Ripple is being sued right left and centre, just to buy time for those banks who made huge amounts of profits by simply pressing a few buttons, having a few middle man companies in between (clearing houses) to add to the complexity and cost of the cross-border payments. Personally, I believe that we will see a settlement once Gensler will take office in the next few months. I really do not think he would like to be remembered as the guy who kicked out all the crypto industry out of the US. Good luck with your investments and decisions on what you buy as this bull market and make sure you lock in profits too. ;-)						View Edits"

So sometime in the past 8+ years XRP became a security without the SEC telling Ripple despite them seeking clarity. Conclusion: The SEC make the rules up as they go along to suit their own agenda. They claim to want to protect investors while at the same time causing chaos resulting in investors losing billions. Corrupt and full of shit is what they are."

For Bitcoin, the road heading down seems much, much longer than the way up. Just doubling the money over there from current prices will requiere even more extreme insanity. Altcoins are at serious peril too with such an overbought Bitcoin, so I'm still glad to take the very decent profit I made in my XRP trade, and place it instead on quality, defensive, dividend yielding value stocks.

2021-02-12 11:57:00,"What will be the catalyst for XRP to take off.  A settlement with the SEC. Before the 22nd of FEB. The SEC drops the suit or revises the charges.  The SEC declares XRP a currency.  The Ripple Company moves out of US and says F*!K it with US they just dont get it.  Why do the XRP hodlers have to endure the pain until all the big fat money greedy bastards decide who gets what.  EX. SEC .....I cant imagine in this current BULL Market with all the altcoins that RIpple is not pushing forward.  Its like we are watching success and innovation pass us by and we are not doing anything about it.  Every day that goes by we (the hodlers and the exchanges are missing out).  The Exchanges and US retail investors are missing out on opportunities.  Let alone that China is pushing out the digital Yuan.  There are many CBDC's that are on the doorstep to go live , and we cant figure out if XRP is a security or a currency.  The DEM's are still trying to impeach a past president because they have a vendetta against this guy.  The priorities of the US right now are no where in the interest of the people.  Who are they kidding, and if you believe this is valid where will the next 4 years bring us.  I am not into politics but the innovation that is taking place right now is passing us by and we are going to pay the price when we finally wake up if we ever do."

2021-02-10 14:41:00,"I keep thinking about how Ripple compares themselves to Exxon or De Beers and I don't think that's quite right.  You can't say XRP is like oil or diamonds because they are both ""mined"" or dug out of the ground.  I read somewhere (I think here) that XRP is probably closer to baseball cards. I like this analogy because card companies print a set number of cards per season, kids collect and trade for fun, but some speculate and hold hoping to cash in one day, and I guess the stats on the back provide utility.XRP is not a security.  Ripple has built their software products around a specific crypto currency blockchain and kept a substantial number of XRP to grow the eco system.  They could have done the same thing with Bitcoin or Ethereum, but they knew Bitcoin was flawed and Ethereum didn't exist back then.  Even if they had chosen another blockchain they could have bought all the underlying crypto asset, before it went mainstream, to secure their future.  Any of us could do the same thing as Ripple right now with one of the many S#!t coin blockchains out there; although, I highly doubt we'd be as successful.As a final thought, there's a game my kids play called Fortnite.  To purchase in game content you need to first purchase a crypto currency called V-bucks.  You can also earn V-bucks by playing the game, but does owning V-bucks mean I own a piece of Epic Games?  Of course not!"

And the fact that this last trend happened after the SEC accepted that they might lose the case indicates that right now XRP is underappreciated. -XRP moving up regardless of other crypto movements is a clear indicator that XRP is finally decoupling from the market, which is just amazing. -We might not see a huge movement (70 cents - 1 dollar or more) until big institutions are willing to buy XRP, and smart players won't allow that until the whole SEC situation is solved. By the time that happens, the whole momentum we have had since December might be over, and the money we need might be somewhere else by then."

Nope!Its those who sold and shouted sell sell sell who were wrong. those idiots opening shorts at the bottom. History has already been proven. Bull market is here. If you didn't sell you didn't lose. Maybe its the other morons you shouldn't have listened to.So if you ask me, I have been pretty much spot on. As for the 20% dip posted yesterday, this morning it dropped from .48 to .41 which is pretty close to 20%.And just to remind everyone. NOBODY saw the law suit coming. Nobody.

2021-02-04 02:33:00,Ready for this to reclaim 0.60 and stay there.
2021-02-04 01:58:00,"XRP/USD this time. I find this chart very interesting, everybody is talking about the large dump, but what nobody is talking about, I believe, is XRP regaining this double ascending channel after the SEC selloff. These types of whipsaws tend to be quite bullish, actually, here for example it confirms the channel strength since it brought the price back from the dead. With this development, XRP is back to normal in many senses, that is, “buying mode”. Not to mention the pump itself looks a bit “bull flaggy”.Finally, the pump not only regained the channel, but also this moving average (my own parameters), and the key horizontal support over here, dashed line. All good technical news.These things further suggest the trend and momentum is flipping bullish on the medium to long term. Personally, I don’t believe we’ll see 0.2, I’d say its heading to 1 dollar from inside the channel. Maybe later in the year."
2021-02-03 23:34:00,I think with all the pump and dump shenanigans it's going to make banks and financial institutions reluctant to use Xrp unless it's fixed at a certain price. Imagine the losses on a large x border transaction taking place just as the price plummeted due to massive manipulation on monday.

Well no more of that crazy way of thinking.Time to be a smart cookie and do the right thing with this XRP. Going to move my entire holding to Kraken from my Nano, set a sell order for .75 and sit back and wait to see if over the next couple of weeks it gets there..... You never know.If not I will drop it to my average coin price sell the lot leave the Fiat on Kraken and wait for it to drop back to mid to low 20s as I am sure this fucker is going to."

2021-02-02 13:14:00,"Be careful trading out there today. As expected, that Buy and Hold XRP was a complete scam. I'm sure there are plenty of buyers out there holding 80 cent XRP, thinking it was going to pump this morning, only to see it crashing and are now emotionally selling it off to get something back, very sad.Until we get regulatory clarity and actual utility use happening, we're going to have to deal with all sorts of scammers trying to fake you out of your money and your crypto. This is a pirate market at the moment. When there's money and desperation involved, it seems a lot of people will pull some shady business tacticsIn my opinion, the best thing you can do right now, is buy when you can at low points and hold it as long as you can. I think everyone in this group has a good idea about what XRP is and it's incredible potential in the new financial system currently unfolding right in front of our eyes now.Just put your long term lenses on, don't stare at the charts all day, hoping it will go up a few pennies. This is big game hunting and one day you will have your chance to sell your XRP to the financial institutions when they need it the most."

2021-02-02 06:33:00,"Ok. Finally it was my mistake not to move today. But it was nice to see that xrp still is able to rise up (2nd time this year)... My first buy-ins were a few years ago at about 50 cts. , later at +1$. After a long time I bought at better conditions. So my average price is lower then 50cts. today. For me nothing has changed. I didnt sell when the price was 15cts. I didn´sale today. I just watch the market.I think there will be a deal with the SEC and then the real potential of xrp will be no longer hidden.Otherwise the price will drop near zero. Thats the game.Nothing changed...When the time has come, I will decide what to do. Not today, not tomorrow but some day when I think there is a change."

2021-02-02 02:30:00,I somewhat feel sorry for the newcommers. I guess people expected this to go like GME ? Anyhow my current feeling is that xrp is one of those crypto that will be driven purely by speculation at least until the SEC case is done. Although US is a smaller market the fact that exchanged have stopped trading just doesnt help XRP. Anyhow as a long time holder of the currency ill just continue and see what comes . Current plan is to just stake the stash i have and make a few bucks on the way. Though i almost had my finger on sell for approx 20-30% of the stash @0.69.
