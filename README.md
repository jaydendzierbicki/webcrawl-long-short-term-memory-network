# XRP Price Prediction using NLP and LSTM Network Model

This project aims to predict the price of XRP cryptocurrency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network model. We will use financial data obtained from Yahoo Finance and forum posts from CryptoCompare, Investing.com, and Yahoo Finance.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to create a prototype solution that combines web scraping, NLP, and machine learning techniques to predict XRP price. The project is divided into four main tasks:

1. Defining the issue to be investigated using NLP methodologies
2. Sourcing data from webpages and supplementing data from knowledge sources relevant to the issue
3. Data wrangling: Cleaning, normalization, feature extraction of the sourced data. Normalization may include applying a word embedding algorithm.
4. Modelling using machine learning (LSTM network model) and evaluation of the model

## Directory Structure

- `task1`: Contains background information (Defining the issue)
- `task2`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for Task 2 (Sourcing data)
- `task3`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for Task 3 (Data wrangling)
- `task4`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for Task 4 (Modelling using LSTM network model)

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Update *


## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if a requirements.txt file is provided) or install them manually.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab in the project folder.
4. Navigate to the desired task folder and open the corresponding Jupyter Notebook.
