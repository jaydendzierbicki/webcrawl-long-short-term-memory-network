# XRP Price Prediction using NLP and LSTM Network Model

This project aims to predict the price of XRP cryptocurrency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network model. We will use financial data obtained from Yahoo Finance and forum posts from CryptoCompare, Investing.com, and Yahoo Finance.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to create a prototype solution that combines web scraping, NLP, and machine learning techniques to predict XRP price. The project is divided into four main tasks:

1. Defining the issue to be investigated using NLP methodologies
2. Sourcing data from webpages and supplementing data from knowledge sources relevant to the issue
3. Data wrangling: Cleaning, normalization, feature extraction of the sourced data. Normalization may include applying a word embedding algorithm.
4. Modelling using machine learning (LSTM network model) and evaluation of the model

## Directory Structure

- `task1`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for Task 1 (Defining the issue)
- `task2`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for Task 2 (Sourcing data)
- `task3`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for Task 3 (Data wrangling)
- `task4`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for Task 4 (Modelling using LSTM network model)

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
